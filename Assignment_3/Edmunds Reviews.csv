":P I like you, Merc. You make me laugh! If Matrix were here, he'd laugh too. Take the gloves off and start swingin'! Alright, let's see if you'll follow this line of questioning: 1. Was that a good picture of a vehicle for a national print ad campaign? 2. I omitted BMW for three very good reasons. One, their ads are consistent to their slogan and mantra, which has NEVER changed. Advertising for a company that never changes, nor has to change, is not particularly difficult. Second, I'm hard pressed to EVER remember a BMW ad, print or otherwise. And third, most of BMW's SUCCESSFUL advertising is through word of mouth, relative to the car's dynamics, and uniqueness compared to the competition in this regard. So how good is BMW at advertising again? 3. Lexus was NOTHING 15 years ago. I had as a better chance of taking over America (and I don't think the world's ready for me ). They were #1 after 10 short years; unprecedented! People still talk about, reference their ORIGINAL, 1989 ads today, at the 2006 NAIAS, they tied in their legendary champaign glass ad into an entire motif encompassing the Lexus lsdisplay, to the delight of all in attendance. The fact that, off the top of my head, I can remember 3 ads, by Lexus, that are now 10, 15, 17 years old, and I wasn't even in the car market?!? I was a snot-nosed punk teenager! I was mackin' this sweet 23 year-old, but I had trouble getting an MTA bus (Still do!)! Mercedes has made a great ad now and then, but Lexus has been consistently strong, and memorable: GS and Macbeth Original ls(champaign - ball bearing, heat lamps, railroad tracks) 1993 ls(archer's bullseye, might've been the '95, but I'm pretty sure it was a mid-gen facelift for 1993) 1997 LexusES (Curvy road - What was that?) 2003 RX (competing engineers driving it, changing the world, again) Mercedes definitely loses points for this last ad. Holmgren laughs at that play call. Good text, bad execution. The photo butchers the ad. Why do you think Brooke Burke is in every stupid ad, from Gambling to Cheeseburgers (during the Super Bowl)? Because she looks great on film! A guy might spend a minute with the ad if she's all over it. It's getting to the point where the advertiser is a footnote, but... DrFill",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am surprised that I did not find any discussionsregarding Audi A8. I currently drive MB C280 and Lexus LX450. Love my Lexus and hate my MB especially during the winter. I'll be looking for a new car in couple of month and my main candidates are BMW 7Series l and Audi A8. Many of my friends use to drive BMW but resently switched to Audi and very happy with this car.Any comments would be appreciated.Thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

". . .let me see if I am following along correctly.1. New STS ushers out the old Seville, period. STS will be the ""only"" offering (at this time) no ""detuned"" less sporty version like the old SLS?2. New '05 Audi interior reminds ""us"" of a Chevy interior and current Audi interiors are boring?Note: OK, I guess I see some similarities in the picures presented above -- what does the STS interior look like -- for comparison?Note2: Boring is a subjective term, the editors of such Car Guy (male or female ""guy"") publications as Car and Driver, Automobile and Road and Track seem to use the Audi interiors as ""the standard that they hold others up to for comparison"" -- often resorting to ""this is an almost Audi-like interior, it is so good"" or ""the Audi interiors are ""jewel like"" with industry leading fit and finish.Note3: Please observe this says nothing for or against Cadillac especially the new STS. The write ups about the new BMW interiors are pretty much all over the board, some like them, some don't, some editors calling them ""stark.""3. The new Cadillac will be ""better"" than the German cars? In what way?Am I correct that the new STS will indeed have a 116"" wheelbase? Wouldn't that contribute to a ""less dynamic"" chassis? Wouldn't that contribute to a more comfortable, smooth, touring car, but, less to some of the dynamics that Audi and BMW (at least) are often praised for having?The fact that the brand new Audi dealer is next to one of the ""best"" Cadillac dealers in Cincinnati, will compel me to look at the STS, especially if it is priced between $45 and $55K (which is where I assume the new Audi A6 will come to). I would only consider the STS with Magnaride and AWD and if a ""sport package"" is on the check sheet, I guess I would also be compelled to test the Caddy and the Audi back to back with similar sporting intentions.Perhaps this is unfair, as it seems like the new STS should be put up against the Phaeton V8 or the Audi a8 (or perhaps even the A8) -- then the Cadillac will most certainly win the MSRP race, to say nothing of a GMAC incentive here and there.Since there seems to be some real passion (pro) for the Cadillac here on this forum, I am keen to find out more. And, since the Audi and the Caddy are, as yet, not on sale, the debate will be, by necessity, based on the pre-release info and preview tests (if any).Over.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
". . .now hold on a minute. A ""current"" A6 4.2 fully optioned -- every possible option, that is -- lists for $58,570. The new model, even with a ""market will bear"" single digit % price increase is unlikely to be too far north of $60K.Cadillac is going to be another 10% on top of that?!?All things being equal, which they never are, how can Cadillac go head to head with Audi, BMW and Mercedes at ""price parity?""Wouldn't ""many"" buyers -- especially in year one and two of the new STS -- think, ""well if I'm gonna layout $60K for a Bimmer or a Cadillac"" go with the ""tried and true"" German?I would think, realistically, that Cadillac would want to ""pull a Phaeton"" and come in 6 - 12% BELOW the European competition.And, won't some Lexus folks scoff at a first year Cadillac STS -- especially one that is ""all new?""I went to the Cadillac website and priced the CTS-V with the sunroof option -- which means virtually every possible thing -- and it came up to $51,195. Try pricing the BMW 545i -- with stick shift -- try $58K.Wouldn't this ""equal content"" for lower bucks theory hold true until the marquis got further into its Led Zep transformation?I have been arguing for a year that the Phaeton is a bargain (perhaps too strong a word), but the same argument would apply to the CTS-V and I would therefore extrapolate ""ditto"" to the upcoming STS.For $66K, I can go elsewhere.Sorry if I have responded too agressively, but I find it difficult to imagine that the new STS V8 will creep too far north of $55K -- at least for the first iteration.Else, he said, perhaps the MSRP will be high, but the deals will be great -- much like the SRX deals (at least here in River City).Of course, Audi could throw a curve and really crank up the price of the A6 -- but, with the new A8 short wheelbase just announced at $66K, it seems Cadillac will price itself out of the market until prospective buyers (such as me) become convinced that ""it isn't my Grand Father's car company any longer. . . .""=====P.S. Went to the Cadillac website, again, created an ""equivalent"" SRX V8 Performance Luxury config w/Entertainment system, rear seat, includes DVD player, LCD display, wireless headphones and remote control &Suspension, Magnetic Ride ControlNo third row seat -- but all other goodies: $55,635.Seems to me an STS, which is sort of what the SRX is should be a bit less. . . .Let the debate continue.End of P.S.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the next A8 will probably be more of a headturner, in the same vein as the A6 and TT. the A8 looks like the previous generation of audis with little visual excitement, though it does look pretty good still. hope audi offers atmospheres in the next A8 like the A6 and A4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"...there's no test, and truly no animosity on my side. You seem under the impression I dilsike or attack Lexus unfairly, when in fact I know it is a brand I have a lot of respect for. Mr denniswade has a very valid point when he says Lexus has established a high bar for reliability. I have not disputed that anywhere. That said, I also know Mercedes does not all of a sudden have a reputation for quirky and oft-breaking cars - that is an overzealous statement.And I am not sure where you go with the Lexus copying Mercedes argument. I seem to sense you mean that since I mentioned the new Mercedes SClass is daring, to *you* Lexus copied from Mercedes and thus must be considered a refreshing design, too. On this matter, all personal opinions are qually valid. But to me the new Lex LexusLS looks a lot like the old LexusLS, and not at all like a new MercSClass. That is just my opinion, and not something I want to try to establish as universal law.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""... a car that virtually no one wants when new..""LJ, are you and Doc getting to much sun these days?? The A8 is often the 1st or 2nd best selling premium sedan in Europe and abroad. And the kick about it's retained value can't be furthest from the truth. If so, why has my W-12 only lost 7.2% of it's total value when in the same token a similarly(to the tilts-ULTRA, the works- NO Euro tho(lol)) equipped lsloses 9.3%? The same can be said about a similarly equipped A8L.A 3 year old car, yet even Edmunds has to admit it is ""better than most in it's class"", a close match with MB. Again, no Lexus was ever mentioned. Further more, you and the other LexIthinkIcans can rant about Audi all you want, but the laughs will stop soon enough, especially when the supposed ""dominator"" LS600h 15 minutes of stardom wears off. For all it's technology, 430hp is akin to a 4-cylinder engine nowadays in this class. Sure it has hybrid, but why does it only get 3mpg better on the hwy than my W-12 with 450hp? Seems like yet another frivilous offer from Lexus again...And it has been quoted that the A8 hasn't won any comparos. HMM? Lexus won ""a"" comparo on the whim that it was tested against a less-powerful and ""base""SClass. The Audi A8 has been tested against all of Europe's, America's, and Japan's tests and I've counted 9 that it has won. So the lswon by a leaning fender, great. But that 3 years ago. The class has moved on and now THEY are playing catch up. Much to late in my opinion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""...the lsis now the trendsetter with the 600HL and it has set the bar beyond the SClass...""While the LS600HL will be a fresh of breath air for the lsline, the LS600hL is touted not to compete with the SClass, but the more establishedSClass, a car whose nameplate has set precedent for others to follow. The LS460(L) will be more at home with the SClass, by making basically the same power, albeit Lexus does it with smaller displacement, but MB gets it done lower in the powerband, thanks to higher displacement.At first glance, the new lsseries looks to be yet another winner for LexusLS. But I surely hope they've corrected the shortcomings of the line(I know for sure styling has been much upgraded). I also hear of a true Euro suspension offering with 20"" wheels and adaptive suspension for both the standard and L models. Looks like they've got a hold on it. Let's hope......I too find it quite interesting that these fine automobile's status is in question. Like Lexus, Audi sells cars that easily fit into the category.The A4 fetches anywhere from $29k to $75k(RS4)The A6, $40k-$101k(S6- $110k for the soon to be released RS6A8, $70k-150k(fully laden W-12 with the extra leather optionQ7- only V8's out now- $48k to $70kR8- 100 grand for a base modelAnd yes the prices are steep, but judging from the 2-3 year wait list for both here in the States and Europe for the RS6, S8, RS4, and R8(up to 3 1/2 year wait), the cars are selling mighty briskly for a ""2nd tier"" company.BTW: I think MB is releasing the SClass CDI(with Blutec technology to ensure better econ than 600H) in response to the threat of the hybrid LS600hL. Doesn't help matters much that they're carrying the ""600"" in the name........",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""(New ES350 is a major disappointment- for some reason I think the interior is the most boring Lexus interior to date)""Now thats interesting, because the ES350 follows the same L-Finesse interior design theme that started with the GS, IS, and now the lsand LexusES. While there's significantly less wood trim in the car compared to the previous ES300\330, I think the overall design is much more modern and generally more attractive. Also, the way Lexus integrated the audio\NAV controls in the previous car seemed like a last-minute hack job (its basically a big hole in the middle of the dash), very unlike their usually expertly done center stack layouts. The new car is 1000% superior in that regard.The old:http://www.autospies.com/images/uploads/medium/2005_ES330_21.jpg?undefinedThe new:http://shows.autospies.com/gallery/AS/es350-interior-vegas-lg/ee.jpg?undefined",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""1. MB&#146;s higher prices have &#150; in the PAST &#150; not prevented it from being the number one unit seller""That happened for ONE year, one single year. Hardly proof of anything. It's seems as though you're determined to forget certain key points that I have already listed in previous posts. The year Mercedes was #1 in the luxury market, they did it with a (at the time) brand new SUV. JUST LIKE LEXUS DOES IT NOW. They never did this with pure car sales. I honestly don't know why that is so hard to see. Now, after about 6 posts you clearly recognize that despite Mercedes higher prices they outsell Lexus on certain models, but yet you expect them to be able to outsell Lexus totally because of that..........again you're ignoring the SUV component. You also keep ignoring the fact that MB has at least 10 cars that costs more than any Lexus. You're acting like 3 C-Class models priced under Lexus are going to make up for the 10 that are priced way above any Lexus and put Mercedes first in sales. Thats backwards. It 3 vs 10. You can't see that MB's lineup is skewed towards the middle and top end?????? They sell most of their cars for 45-50K or better, right where Lexus tops out, average sales wise. Only the SC430 and LexusLS consistantly sell for a higher average price than 50K. The GS430 sales as if it's about as rare as a M5 or AMG product. Like you stated earlier the ""what if"" and now ""lets pretend"" stuff is silly but... The answer to your overall question is NO because unless the ""Lex"" costs the same as a Rolex, Brietling there is no way the higher priced brands are going sell in the same numbers. What you're reaching for doesn't exists. Curiously enough you left price out of the ""pretend"" scenario. Rolex's and Brietling's watches costs as much as some of these cars we're talking about here, how in the world would they every sell in greater numbers than a much cheaper brand. That doesn't make sense. I mean in all seriousness you should really research this. Since anyone can remember Cadillac was #1 in unit sales. Why? Becasue their best selling car, the DeVille used to costs about what the ES330 costs today, that combined with lots of fleet sales put them over the top year after year. The SUV (Lincoln Navigator) is what caused Lincoln, for the first time in the modern era to surpass Cadillac for #1 in 1998. Cadillac was so devestated by this they actually tried to lie about their sales numbers. Mercedes was never, ever in the running until the ML came along. Mercedes' best year prior to the intro of the ML was 1986!!! Even in that year, they didn't sell more than 100K units. True they outsold BMW for years and years, but that too changed in the 90's because BMW became red-hot (with the 3 and 5) and they too costs less, in most cases, not all. Nor does BMW try to sell so many cars at the top end. BMW has only one car over 100K, the 760Li. The Z8 is winding down now, and it never did more than 300-400 units a month. The ML and to a much lesser extent the CLK (20K in a good year), which is a lot cheaper than the previousEClass based Coupe got Mercedes into the sales race. Only since 2002 did they decide to add so many C-Class variants that I sometimes can't keep track of all of them. Detroit? Oh yes, I'll be there, it's the single most important autoshow in America. There is so much debuting there (Corvette, Ferrari 612S, SLR, 6-Series, surprises from Audi, BMW and others) this year that it should be mandatory for anyone that even remotely likes cars....lol. footie, Yep those are the only reasons a Mercedes costs more and a Lexus or Infiniti costs less. It has nothing to do with most of those Lexuses and Infinitis being based on much cheaper every day cars to begin with.

Why do you act like Cadillac is the only manufacturer that has ever put out a less than perfect product.

"""In your opinion, what is Build Quality vs Reliablity? Are they mutually exclusive?""The short answer is no they aren't mutually exclusive. Lexus blends them very well, on the whole probably better than anyone else. I'm just guessing here, but I think you knew this, but wanted me to admit that? Anyway...with Audi they are exclusive traits. When you open the door of a A8, A6 or A4 you feel the heft, when you sit down your senses are delighted by the sheer quality of the interior plastics, wood, chrome, aluminum and the way it all all assembled. The A4 Cabriolet is stunning this reguard, try one out. The convertible top and it's folding structure are overbuilt. Look at the trunk hinges on the upcoming VW Phaeton, overbuilt and really not necessary, but they scream quality. You'd think an Audi would be very reliable too, considering the last forever ""feel"" of their cars. Audi has more problem than either Mercedes or BMW, and gulp(!) admittedly more serious ones at that (trans, engine etc). So really the answer to the question depends on the brand being discussed. Mercedes for example used to be the standard in build before they starting cutting cost. Mercedes' problem is that when they used to insist on overbuilding their cars they really didn't have much competition, yet when they decided to downgrade their interior fittings, the Japanese appeared and BMW, Audi, and all the rest got much better at it. The funny thing is that Audi and Mercedes use the same (French) supplier for the SClass and the A8, but Audi pays for higher specification, thus VW's thinner profit margins. Mercedes specifies thicker gauge steel and sheet metal (Volvo does too) for safety purposes, magnesium seat frames and so on..all costing...while not really noticeable by the average buyers, unless you get into an accident.....while using lesser grade materials for things that didn't relate to safety. This is most easily seen in the 1999 SClass compared to the 2000SClass. The British and German press continue to insist that Mercedes is going old-school with build quality, and focusing more heavily on reliability with the nextSClass, but for a price. There was a tear down study done about a year ago comparing newer Mercedes' with older ones. Surprisingly they found that the newer cars structure/chassis was just as robust as the older cars, but the decontenting mainly came in the areas of interior panel thickness, plastics for just about everything and seat frames. Interesting indeed. All car companies decontent in some way or another, but they do it differently. Toyota does it where you can't see it and where the average car buyer is not likely to care.

"""Lexus manufactures a car to a price point while the ""German Dogs"" manufacture a car to a standard""In the old days that was true about MB - today that standard has reached and all-time low (again for MB) and it is way too low for me. With them about to cut corners with costs (they have no choice unless they want to keep losing money) it is bound to worsen.What are you guys going to come up with next that the engines idle .1 degree cooler. This has reached the point of desperation.The business argument - I made a statement that a high percentage of those buying lux cars are business savy people who can't miss headline events about MB having quality and financial problems. I then say it is logical that they will keep that in mind when buying or leasing anew because filing away things like that in their mind is how they got where they are. It is turned around on here by those who can't seem to handle that statement to read like people are investigating 10K's and 10Q's before their next purchase. Let's get real here about what was said and logical follow through. If anyone thinks news events like the ones MB are going through don't - at a minimum - at least give many knowledgable people cause to think twice then you have really lost it. The safety discussion has reached a point of absurdity. These cars are all safe and who invented what is the last thing anyone cares about or even knows when buying a car.The LexusLS being 70% of the SClass is hysterical. It has a 110% victory in engine and about a 125% victory in power right off the bat. MB has a cost structure that is badly inefficient with sky high labor costs, cheap plasticky parts and lower and lower quality every year. You say Lexus is lower quality than that and less car becaues they are the opposite - extreme efficiency with the car essentially built by robots from day one in 1990 and the cars are as high quality as it gets as a result. The dreaded surveys you guys can't handle are a testament to that - for what - 12 years and running now. You are really lost becaues here is what your are saying - Lexus has to get grossly inefficient and increase its build cost with expensive labor and then the price rises and it is in a league with theSClass. In essence that is your argument and that is absurdly ridiculous. Saying Lexus took the LexusLS interior from the Camry is a close second though in the ridiculous meter. Again - we are in desperation city when you see comments like that.merc1 - I'll never waste my time reading thru the posts but more than once you said you have problems with the C-class and you'd not be a buyer of the car. My point is simple - the Lexus crowd has no problems buying, heck automatically buying, the cars in their price range. They eagerly await the next car because they are buyers of it. You eagerly await the next Benz because you are a fan of it. That is a mighty big difference right from the start. When push comes to shove the MB car in your price range was passed on. The hard evidence will always side with those who put their money where their mouth is. That's life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not only has that, but Lexus often trails behind several years before it adopts new technology. For example, it took Lexus until 1992 to adopt the front passenger airbag, 4 years behind Mercedes. Again, it took Lexus until 1999 to adopt Electronic Stability Control, 4 years behind Mercedes. BMW introduced head protection airbags in 1997, 2 years before Lexus. Volvo introduced side airbags in 1994, 3 years before Lexus.Even now, many Lexus vehicles lack the most basic safety features found in competing cars. For example, you won't be able to find a single Lexus model that offers rear side airbags. Mercedes provides rear side airbags as standard equipment and BMW as optional. The GS430 and IS300 don't offer rear side head protection airbags; a standard feature on all Mercedes, BMW and Volvo vehicles. The 1989 Mercedes SClass was the first convertible to offer and automatic roll bar. 16 years later the 2005 Lexus SC430 doesn't offer any such system, even though the BMW 3, Audi A4 and Volvo S70 convertibles do for half the price. The LexusLS and ES330 the only Lexus vehicle that offers rear seatbelt ETD and force limiters; standard features across the entire model line with Mercedes and Volvo and optional on most BMW.Face it, Lexus has never been a leader in safety innovation nor have they shown any particular dedication to safety. Mercedes on the other hand, has been concerned with safety as its top priority since day 1. ""Do any of its RECENT innovations even begin to compare with the importance of hybrid powertrains?""Well considering that Mercedes&#146; pioneering ESP system alone accounts for a 56% reduction in fatal single vehicle crashes... I would say that just this single recent innovation easily trumps the importance of hybrid powertrains.""Do you find it meaningless, in a competitive sense, that a brand has gone from nonexistent to number 1 right under MB's nose?""Is it remarkable that Toyota managed to sell so many ""Lexus"" vehicles since 1989? Yes it is. But to say Lexus is ""number 1"" is your obviously biased opinion. By ""number 1"" I assume you mean number 1 in sales? If so, don't forget to account for cost. Lexus sells its cars for less money than does Mercedes, thus it is only logical that Lexus would sell more cars. Kia sells more Spectras than Lexus sells more lss... that doesn't make the Spectra a better car; it's simply a function of cost. Lexus is like that fat kid in grade school who was always copying everyones homework because he was too lazy/stupid to do his own.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""What interests me is that their new models today (especially the E) are clearly German and MB but are at the leading edge of luxury car styling.""Aren't you hyping that a bit too much? MB is hardly on the leading edge in this regard. I'd give that title to Jaguar. I'd put MB somewhere in the middle, and Audi right after Jaguar. Also, VW did a nice job with the Phaeton. It's a sleek handsome car. I still think they should have marketed it as an Audi. As for Lexus' worldwide plans I don't anticipate them being as successful there. Europeans tend to favor their home brands more than Americans do. Some of it is nationalism. I sincerely doubt Lexus is going to make headway in a country like Germany, but has and will be successful in the UK. I see ls's everywhere here in London. There are several Lexus dealers around the area. Plenty of GS's and RX's about too. As usual time will tell.SV",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""You think so huh? Do you even know what ""comparision"" he was talking about. If you mean someting dealing with theSClassthen you're as lost as he is because I haven't mentioned theSClassin this round. Period. If the SCand SClass aren't competitors then theSClass/ SClass and LexusLS aren't either right? Don't they have a 20K base price difference too?""Okay, you asked for an explanation, and I can give it to you, just be patient. When someone decides to buy a new car, they usually set a goal price...usually the top price they will pay, out the door. This is even before they start looking at and comparing different models. They might have a few models in mind, but the real comparison starts after the goal price is set. I think we could all agree that price is the most common limiting factor(do not confuse with determining factor) in a new car purchase, right? So in the sense of the market, the LexusLS is more of a competitor with the E430. There is the basic answer to your question. Same goes with the SCversus the SL...in terms of the market, the SC430 is more of a competitor with the CLK. ------------------------------However, the issue you push is comparison. There is a difference between cars that are comparable and cars that are competitors. The lsis comparable to theSClass. The GS is comparable to EClass . For me personally, the SCand the SClass dont even compare. Sure, the arangement is pretty similar, but the purpose is completely different. The SClass was designed with performance and luxury. The SChas never intended any emphasis on performance, other than having a fairly powerful engine. The same goes with the LexusES and theCClass. They are competitors, however they do not compare in my mind. FWD never has competed with RWD in my mind though. But that doesnt stop them from competing. ----------------------Competing encompasses price as a major priority, because that is how cars compete in peoples minds. Comparing does not encompass price. You could compare a Pontiac Bonneville with a BMW 745, if your only consideration was size...however that does not mean they are competitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. I'm not going to get into the reliability thing again, yes Mercedes has a problem, a pretty good size one at that. I meant that all the negative press has been a sales handicap, not the problems themselves, they are just that problems. I'm sure Mercedes has lost more than a few sales with the survey worshiping crowd. 2. Your second point is dead wrong and has no basis simply because if Mercedes has, according to you 3 cars that cost less than the cheapest Lexus, then they surely have at least 10 that cost way more than any Lexus, CL55, CL500, CL600, SClass, S55, SL500, SL55, SL600,SClass, and the E55. You're telling me that all these much higher priced cars don't count? I clearly stated that the ES330 outsells the C-Class. ""If the LexusES shouldn&#146;t be added to the IS when comparing to C-Class sales, then what does the LexusES go up against?""First of all the C-Class variants are of the same car, with different engines and trims etc. The IS300 and ES330 don't share anything, not even the same engine or platform, so it would be merely reaching to try and lump their sales together. The LexusES competes with the C-Class to a degree, thats why I stated before that it does outsell the C. I personally find it's biggest competitors to be Buicks, which is what it rides/handles/drives like, although it's much better built. And probably the I35, which is about the only other foreign car playing the fwd card in this price class now. The Acura TL has moved towards being sporty. 3. So basically you just proved what I said, out of the whole Autonation group you found 4 base C230s, yet according to you they're so plentiful to the point of pumping up Mercedes' sales numbers. Right. Remember I never even mentioned Lexus' MSRP's vs what they actually had available, you're just now mentioning that. Now again what does the price relationship of the IS and the base C models have do with the entire Mercedes lineup of cars compared to Lexus'? Do you not see that Mercedes is just as loaded with big $$$ cars as they are with cheaper ones? Especially compared to Lexus. No because that wouldn't fit in with your theory. ""The point is (as I tried to indicate with wording like ""the ENTIRE product line"" and ""the total lineup"") that the totality of MB's line (all cars, all SUVs) starts at a lower price point than Lexus.""That simply doesn't mean much because Mercedes sells a good number of E, S, and SClass cars, relative to their competion, and like unlike Lexus, Mercedes sales gains of the past few years weren't made on just one car and 2 SUVs, they were made on nearly everything they sell, except the ML and SLK. Plus, plus the C's starting priced compared to the IS300's isn't repeated anywhere else in the lineup of these two brands. The E320 surely doesn't base for less than the GS300, the SClass most certainly doesn't base for less than the LexusLS, ditto SL500 vs SC430. Again, we see who's cars really costs more.......""yet Lexus still outsells MB (total product line). ""Yes they do because of SUVs!! You keep stating this while trying to show me sales numbers for C-Class cars, of which only the ES330 manages to outsell it, WHAT ABOUT THE E vs the GS, S vs LexusLS, SClass vs SC, C vs IS........the relationship in each case either a) Mercedes outsells the Lexus, or b) they are in a dead heat. You're trying to attribute Lexus' sales lead to cars, and it isn't. Then on top of that you're claiming that because 3 Mercedes' are cheaper than the IS300, that Lexus has made some kind of stunning achievement based on car sales, when the reality (cold and the hardest of numbers) of it is that Mercedes outsells or sells the same amount of cars as each competing Lexus car model. The one and only exception to this is the C-Class vs the ES330. The sales dominance you keep harping on isn't based on Lexus' car sales!! What you're doing is like comparing a company like Ford to Honda, and claiming that Ford outsells Honda, which is true, but like you know who, Ford's truck sale numbers are extremely impressive, while Honda sells more Accords........its the same exact scenario. The bottom line is that if you going to look at how many cars Mercedes has that are cheaper (3) than the cheapest Lexus, then you have to look at how many they have that are more expensive than any Lexus, without even looking at the MB website I count 10. Ten compared to Three!!! I agree that ultimately the SUV vs CAR things is really irrelvant because in the end total sales is what will be counted up for the press releases due Jan 1, 2004. I'm only using the seperation of the two because you're trying to act like Lexus sales lead is due to moving more cars which couldn't be any further from the truth. michael_mattox, What I do understand is that you had nothing factual to back up your previous claims.

"(Also posted on Lexus GS450h forum) Last week I was in Osaka. I had the hotel concierge locate a Lexus dealer for me. The closest was three subway stops away. Lexus was introduced in Japan last August. The building was new, of contemporary architecture three stories high. The interior was very elegant and refined. Reception and a showroom on first floor with some offices. The second foor had a lounge and more offices and an additional car display area. The third floor was devoted to service with quite a few car lifts. There is an elevator to transport cars from street level to the service floor. A very impressive facility. I was surprised to learn it was owned by Toyota. They've made a huge investment. The only cars currently sold are the IS250, IS350, GS350, GS450 and SC430. Contrary to a recent post, the LexusLS is not available: it's still sold as a Celsior at Toyota dealers. The upcoming lswill be sold at the Lexus stores. The RX400h is also not sold there. The GS450h will arrive in March, the same time as for the USA. A GS430 on display had a beautiful very light blue pearl color (the Japanese designation is 074) not seen in the USA. I suspect we don't get the same color choices. The sales consultant I talked to spoke English. He had an appointment coming up and when I left he pointed to the SClass Mercedes that had parked with the client emerging. Added comments for this forum: I stayed at the Hilton. Just a short distance away adjacent to the Ritz-Carlton hotel is a Cornes store. Cornes is a Japanese dealer in luxury cars with a store in Tokyo which also sells Bentley. The Osaka store is devoted to Ferrari and Maserati. They had a Ferrari 430 and 612 Scaglietti and a Maserati coupe and quattroporte on display. These are all elegant cars. I would have no interest in purchasing one. I am #1 at my Lexus dealer for the upcoming GS450h and would be interested in any upcoming lshybrid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(This crowd has gone deathly silent....) The car is MUCH better styled than the 760 orSClass. This is a good thing! I'm fully confident it has enough features to handle theSClass, head-to-head. If it starts anywhere south of $100k, it is a great value compared to the Germans, especially theSClass. My problem is, if it's not going to be out until next April, why put it now? I don't se how this helps the 460, which isn't out either. It hurts it more than helps it! I would've done this half-hearted intro in Tokyo, and then the full specs in Detroit next year. Then in Ny next year, you can say ""Arriving in showrooms this week!"", or whatever. I would feel better if the said ""450+HP"". I want to be sure it exceeds the 760, plus gets 60-70% better mileage (real-world). Since the V12 in the Benz is twin-turbo charged, Mercedes has no intention of losing a HP war, and Lexus doesn't need, or wnat to fight that. The design is elegant and expensive. They styling is clean, confident, and two steps above the LexusLS. The fact that AWD is standard will be big in the Northeast, and Chicago. IF it's going to be $40k less than aSClass, similar in size and appointments, to some better looking, maybe .5 seconds slower, but maybe 10 MPG more efficient, and has all this hype behind it, with a heavy rep to match, the SClass has a much tougher road to hoe. My pause is more about the marketing this way, at this time. I wouldn't do it this way, with a full year to go, and the 460 not out for 6 months. The 760 is done, and the SClass is walking out of NY with a several limp! There's still some Kool-Aid left. And a smile! DrFill",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> I'll be awaiting some of this ""free money"". You're grasping here, really.When I was talking to my banker last month making IRA contributions, he was trying hard to push a quarter million dollar line of credit on me, absolutely no collateral required. Practically anyone with a job can ride in an LexusLS, S or 7 nowadays if having a luxury car is his/her highest priority in life. Credit is indeed that easy nowadays. For most people however, whether a feature in a car is worthwhile is the deciding factor whether they are getting it (including V8); there is hardly any car that is truely unaffordable any more. People cross shop cars in a general price range after they decide how much they can spend. You'd be surprised at how many people cross-shop ES330 vs. 3Series, with the TL in between. They are all competitors. Four years ago, I cross-shopped the three myself, plus the one I ended buying, the Saab 9-5. For what it's worth, last year, I cross shopped the tall wagon versions of the two, Highlander Limited 3.3 vs. X3, and came home with the Highlander. BMW lost me on both occasions due to lack of engine torque and useable interior space. > Porsche doesn't offer a V8 sports car and their situation relative to their > competition is like totally irrelevant. Sports cars like the 911 and its competitors > line up even worse when looking at price. Totally irrelevant bringing up Porsche. 911 vs. Corvette is the classic high end sports car comparo. It's been done numerous times. Your assertion of irrelevence is quite irrelevent.> It proves my point about the GS430 not being the 5Series competitior as a > sports sedan, like I stated at the beginningHardly relevent. 545i does not equate to 5Series, which mostly consist of 525i and 530i. GS430 is very much a competitor to 5Series as far as being a luxury car with sporty pretensions are concerned. That's all people are buying those cars for. How many people race their $60k commuters on weekends anyway?> No I didn't say the 545i was better in handling over the 530i.That was a late night typo on my part. From the context, both of us actually agree that 530i outhandles 545i due to better weight distribution. So now we have a GS430 out scoring 530i on more than one comparos, losing to 545i in one. Yet enthusiasts like ourselves consider 530i outhandling 545i . . . Looks like all three are quite well matched depending on the buyer's priorities. i.e. Lexus hits the market quite well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. Funny how everyone who believes Lexus should jump up the price of the '07 lsnever bought one before, and the people who actually have bought one (or more) believe slow and steady increases are the way to go. As someone who bought a nicely equipped '05 ls(list $62,730) for about $57,000 cash, I am not interested in seeing a big jump, but would potentially tolerate a moderate increase. I imagine that Lexus would be more interested in the real world reaction of actual potential repeat-buyers whose business they don't want to lose, than in the musings of armchair theorists who want to talk about higher price=higher prestige, etc.2. What is the price of a reasonably well-equipped 7SeriesL or a8 versus the prices Len is predicting for a similarly equipped 460L? Is it really that much different? Or is this debate much ado about nothing?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. I didn't call the A8 a loser, but I said ""I can see how someone would call it a Loser"" There is a difference. The lsmight be better than all the premium sedans you can name, but the A8, to me, is the MOST desirable! 2. My point is getting twisted quickly, and often. As I've said several times before, there is more than one way to be a ""winner"" in the marketplace. YOu can outshine others dynamically, in comparisons, change the marketplace, or just outsell the competition. By comparing the SCto cars that are ""Losing"" in the market or segments, I am disproving the SCas a ""Loser"". I don't believe in degrees of ""Loser"". The A8 doesn't sell, and doesn't win comparisons. And it hasn't affected it's segment, except to bring in the Pheaton, which was a true ""Loser"". AS MUCH AS I LIKE THE A8, I'd have to slap a ""Loser"" tag on it. That kinda goes for the Audi line, in general. It really isn't the A8's fault. The company hasn't made any headway over the last 10-15 years. Lexus has conquered countries in 10 years, what has Audi done again? The SChas EXCEEDED sales expectation for 4 years in a row. Does Lexus, or it's many owners, see it as a loser? Resale values? How they doin'? Ok. For Lexus, I'd call the ES250 (1990-1992), the GS300 (1993-1997), and the IS300 (2001-2005), ""Losers"". That's all. Considering many companies are currently dragging 2 or 3 around, per year, that's pretty impressive, for 15+ years! There's a difference between cars you may not like, and ""losers"".

"2-3 out of 20+ models says nothing. Look, your argument has been shot down before. YOu know when you say every Lexus is copied off of Benz, yet you can't come up with anything except for the LexusLS. If you count little styling cues as being knock-offs, everything would be a knock-off of everything else. Take a look at the 5Series, the rear end looks like a old Kia Rio, even MT caught that one, the current CLK looks like it has bits of Volvo C70 coupe and Mustang in the rear, the new RL rear looks like a number of cars, Hyundai XG, BMW 7Series, the rear of the BMW 6-series has been compared to the old Chrysler Cirrus. And the rear of the LexusLS looks a bit like theSClass. big deal. What else can you come up with besides the LexusLS and MR2? Nothing?

"1. If you look at my original post, I never claimed that Lexus has out-innovated MB specifically in SAFETY since 1990. I did claim that, since 1990, Toyota/Lexus innovations IN TOTAL are at least as significant to the industry as MB innovations. 2. For all of MB&#146;s 120 years of safety innovations, does the SClass actually end up safer than the 15-year-young LS? Actually, not according to real-world data. Check the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety website:http://www.iihs.org/vehicle_ratings/ictl/ictl_lux.htmand you&#146;ll find that the lshas 16% LESS personal injury losses than the S (46 vs 55 based on 100 equaling average injury losses?both are very safe, but the lsis clearly SAFER).""Mercedes on the other hand, has been concerned with safety as its top priority since day 1."" Maybe so, but it seems Lexus has done a better job of it, based on real-world hard numbers.3. &#147;Well considering that Mercedes&#146; pioneering ESP system alone accounts for a 56% reduction in fatal single vehicle crashes... I would say that just this single recent innovation easily trumps the importance of hybrid powertrains.&#148; I have to disagree here. You seem to take fatalities as the measure of a carmaker&#146;s worth to the world. What about fatalities due to pollution? Do you recognize that hybrid powertrains, once more widely adopted (including by the Germans, once they &#147;copy&#148; the technology), will save many many lives due to fuel savings and hence lower emissions?From the Washington Post: ""The researchers examined the health effects of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by focusng on four cities: New York City, Mexico City, Santiago in Chile and Sao Paulo in Brazil. They found that using readily available technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would also cut emissions of pollutants, because both are released when fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas are burned. And those reductions would avoid 64,000 premature deaths, 65,000 cases of chronic bronchitis and 37 million person-days of restricted activity IN JUST THOSE FOUR CITIES over the next 19 years.""The quote isn't particular to hybrids and is only intended to show that reducing pollution saves lives just as surely as incremental airbags. Exactly how many lives might be saved by hybrid technology over the next couple of decades I don't know, and don't have the time to try to calculate.Now I know that someone is going to mention diesels and my response is, diesels have been in cars for almost 70 years, they aren't exactly a recent innovation.4. By ""number 1"" yes I did mean U.S. vehicle sales. To your point that ""Lexus sells its cars for less money than does Mercedes, thus it is only logical that Lexus would sell more cars."" I would respond:a. MB's U.S. product line actually starts LOWER in price than does Lexus'. If you eliminate all of MB's models at price points higher than Lexus' highest price point, Lexus still outsells MB in the U.S., only by a wider margin. MB product is available in the entire Lexus pricerange, and then some. Why can't MB outsell Lexus if price is the barrier?b. Some value needs to be accorded MB's higher prestige. If a Timex watch were physically IDENTICAL to a Rolex, except for the brand name, don't you think Rolex could still price somewhat higher, but sell the same number of units as the physically same but lower-prestige Timex?Since MB has more ""content"" in the form of prestige, it follows that consumers should be willing to pay a little more but still buy it in the same numbers as Lexus.

"1487, wake up dude. Is the RX300 still not the SUV sales leader in it's market category? Which SUV out of them RX300, MDX, X5, ML, and QX4 sells in greater numbers? True the RX300 does not sell 90K units like it did in the first 2-3 years of its cycle, but 60K is still better than what the competition is selling, and most of the competition has newer models(MDX, X5) and the sales numbers still don't match the RX300. Not just that, but the RX300 is darn old. Compared to the MDX especially, it's smaller in just about every dimension, doesn't have the driving dynamics of the MDX, and is underpowered next to the MDX, but it still outsells it. I can see your continued pessimism being a hard-core Cadillac fan, but realistically, if a 5-year old SUV design is outselling newer better and similarly priced vehicles, what makes you think a totally new better newer similarly priced RX won't sell more than 60K units? Yes, Competition will limit the RX 's success, and I will even doubt the RX will sell 90K units a month, but neither will the MDX or Caddy SRX sell 90K a year because of the crowded entry level luxury SUV segment you speak of. On the other hand, you have to remember that the cross-over SUV segment is still growing(not like it was in the late 90s, but it's still growing) in the double-digit range. Old people buying luxury cars is not the problem. Simply put, the older a person is, generally, the more expensive car that he/she can afford. Therefore, young people generally cannot afford big-buck luxury cars unless the young person is inherently rich, a pro sport player, a entertainer, a drug dealer, hit the lottery, or is extremely smart and well educated and makes tons of money at a young age. But obviously, we know that all those groups put together constitute a very small percentage of the luxury car buying public. Everyone in here acknowledge's in here that older people buy Lexus cars, just like older people buy Cadillac, Lincoln, Mercedes, BMW, and Jaguar. What you have a failure acknowledging is that even less young people find any Cadillac model appealing than Lexus models. Please take a survey if you go to college, or wherever and see how many young people(college aged maybe?, 20-30 age group?) and see what they would rather be driving, a Cadillac or a Lexus. Guaranteed results would be a vast majority would pick a Lexus over a Cadillac. I'm only 27, and I prefer Lexus far over Cadillac. In fact, out of all Luxury car makes Cadillac would be next to last right ahead of Lincoln. 1)BMW 2)Lexus 3)Audi 4)Infiniti 5)Jaguar 6)Mercedes 7)Cadillac 8)Lincoln.The only Cadillac I like is the STS, because it hasn't gone to that lame new edge design philosophy yet. The CTS has awesome driving ability, but it's styling inside & out is hideous, what was Cadillac thinking? On top of that I have many wealthy friends, some inherently rich, some to actually earned it in the computer industry the last few years, I don't see any of them with any cadillac product, but I do see them with Audi's, BMW's, Lexus', mostly BMW's though. Yes, Cadillac will probably add 5-6K a month in sales. But you still fail(consistently) to realize that Lexus as well as BMW and Mercedes have new models coming out next year. In Lexus case, the GX470, a new RX , a new GS330/430, and a SC330. As I know you so well from just a couple of posts, I know the response to come. ""Cadillac barely has a price advantage versus the Germans. They have nothing to compete with the 7Series or class but when you look at the prices of other models they arent cheap. The Deville's prce range is $42-58K, Seville $46K-57K, CTS $30K-$40K, escalade $50K-$56K."" Cadillac has a big price advantage and dealers give huge discounts. $58K for a Deville. I think not. I have heard the DTS with the night vision is made in very few numbers. And again, here's the word, realistically, most Deville's are sold at the lower end of that price spectrum. Same with the Seville, and CTS. So really, Caddy does have a advantage, a big advantage(while you're at it don't forget to mention the 0% financing deal GM is throwing around). And the DTS's competition is basically itself. You're not going to see a whole lot of DTS buyers cross-shopping a LexusLS,SClass, or 745il. It's just not going to happen. The DTS's competition is basically the Lincoln Town Car. The Cadillac XLR will be more expensive than the Lexus SC430. What do you think that will do for Cadillac? You think it's going to be a better car than the Mercedes SL500? Do you really feel Cadillac will sell more than 1,000 units a month after the first few months? Do you really think most people who can afford a $70K+ car are going to jump from their SLs, XK8's to the XLR? I bet Infiniti is going to improve alot in the coming years, I don't see the same with Cadillac. General Motors talked about beating the competition all thru the 90's, and it always never happened. ""Also, I dont think anyone buys a lexus for the looks. Let's be realistic. Out of all the major Luxury makers Lexus has the worst styling. call it subjective if you want to but I never hear anyone that doesnt own a lexus call their cars attractive.

"1487, As always, your posts always have issues.""I will say this again, you have to consider what a car offers when you look at the price."" What you say or think doesn't really matter in the marketplace, now does it? I will say this again also, car pricing is based on MORE than just what it has physically. Car prices also include what people are willing to pay for intangibles. In the case of a Mercedes, people pay thousand of dollars for the 3-pointed star. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't pay more for a car with the 3-pointed star, I really do think people who pay thousands more for the prestige factor of a Mercedes are insane, but I don't set the market price neither do you. The marketplace as a whole sets the price and that basically means a car will cost more just because it has a 3-pointed star on the hood. And frankly let's face it, a Cadillac is no Mercedes. Therefore, even if the XLR had the same equipment, the same performance, the same build quality, the price in the marketplace would be lower for the XLR because it lacks 1 thing: The 3-pointed star(Prestige & heritage). ""I dont understand how Cadillac isnt allowed to charge $70K for a car when they have cars going up to $60K right now.""Let's get realistic. On paper Cadillac has cars that cost near $60K. Again I'll go through this, the price is really much less because of a few reasons: 1) Cadillac's are discounted deeply. 2)GM is always throwing out incentives to sell cars. This is in either of 3 ways, one is thru subvented leasing, two is thru factory or dealer rebates and three is thru subsidized financing(0%). 3) Cadillac sells very few cars fully loaded. Cadillac charging $60K for cars is like stating the LexusLS goes for $70K or the SClass goes for $100K. Why is this thinking false? It is false because we all know the average LexusLS costs nowhere near $70K MSRP. The Majority of lss sold are somewhere in the low $60K range. Same with theSClass, the most popular SClass is theSClass, which doesn't cost $100K. And therefore, saying the Cadillac's cost $60K us just a wee bit(actually much more)misleading. ""They know that to be seen as competitive they have to offer models that are in the same bracket as top MB and BMW models and that is what they are doing."" I remember proving this statement wrong previously also. Where is Cadillac offering models in the same brackets as MB & BMW? As of know, Cadillac has no competition for the ML320 or X5. Don't forget the SRX isn't out yet. Cadillac has nothing that competes with the SLK, Z4 at the lower end of the roadster spectrum. Cadillac has no coupe or station wagon version of the CTS. Cadillac has nothing to compete with the 5Series orEClass. Cadillac has nothing to compete with the 7Series orSClass, and Cadillac has nothing at the high end of the spectrum such as a Z8, SL55,SClass. Where is the model for model competition?""I really wish the SC430 would drop out of this discussion. I dont think anyone really considers that car to be on the same level as the expensive euro convetibles."" If really nobody considers the SC430 to be a competitor with the euro convertibles, let me tell you, nobody is going to even consider a $70K Cadillac convertible against anything European or Japanese. ""The first Escalade was predicted to be a failure,the '02 escalade was faintly praised but still called nothing more than a Tahoe with a caddy badge, the EXT was criticized"" The first escalade wasn't predicted to be a sales failure, it just predicted that it would be a POS, which it was. After all, it wasn't a Cadillac in any sense of the word. It was merely a chromed up Denali. I don't ever remember the '02 Escalade being called a failure. In fact ever since it has come out, it's been pretty well regarded. The EXT is merely a Avalance. That's reason enough for it to be criticized. ""the CTS was supposed to be a slow seller because of its styling"" Who said anything about slow seller? I just said it was ugly and it can't hold a candle to cars such as the G35, IS300, 3Series or C320. ""If badge sets price why are lexus vehicles so much cheaper, model-to-model, than BMW and MB vehicles?"" Refer back to the beginning of the post about prestige. Lexus doesn't have the prestige of a Mercedes, Lexus has only been around 12 years. ""I have already established that most caddy models are more expensive than Lexus models.""Key word ""I"". The only thing you have established is that YOU think they are more expensive. But really quite the contrary. RX300s cost about $40KES300s cost about $35-$40KGS300/430s cost about $45K-$55KLS430s cost about $55K to $70KIS300s cost about $35KLX470s cost about $65KSC430 cost about $62K i thinkCTS runs about $35KSeville about $48K to $55KDeville about the same.Let's not forget what I went over earlier in this post: Cadillacs are heavily discounted and they have heavy incentives. Let's not forget how skewed the Deville sales figures are because of fleet sales. You have established something that only you yourself believe. ""Also, why would the XLR have to a ""much better"" car than the Sc430 if its going to cost the same or slightly more? The XLR will be faster, it looks much better and it has far more technology than the SC430 so it sure as hell should cost more."" One answer can explain it all: Prestige. Lexus has it over Cadillac, by a long shot. Really? how much faster is it going to be? by a few-tenths of a second, and that's not much. More technology? I haven't seen much on it's soo superior technology. Is it going to have the build quality of a Lexus or the reliability? I doubt that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1487, Lexus sales are not reliant on the RX300. Lexus was reliant a few years back when the previous ES300 was aging but the RX300 thru calender year 2002 makes up 31% of Lexus sales. Here's a breakdown: RX300 31%ES300 31%LS430 11%SC430 6%GS300/400 7%IS300 9%LX470 4% That shows Lexus sales are hardly reliant on just the RX300. And remember, The GX470 is right around the corner, as well as a new redesigned RX300 and LX470 not to mention for 2004 a new GS-series. I love the pesimistic attitude that people have about Lexus; comments like ""If you take away this one model, Lexus sales are nothing"", or ""BMW, Mercedes, AUdi are coming up with better products all the time and by next year Cadillac's lineup will be solid"". Do you forget one thing? BMW, Mercedes Audi aren't the only ones coming up with better products, Lexus products are also constantly improving as are now Infiniti's. Lexus expanding product line is constantly expanding and becoming more solid year by year, as next year will be the intro. of the GX470 as well as all new RX300, '04 the GS-series and for '04 the SC330. ANd really what is going to make Cadillac's lineup so darn impressive next year? The CTS I like, it's a very nice car. But the SRX cross-over will come out. ANd a new Seville for '04 I believe. That's not really enough to catapult them over Lexus in sales, especially considering what I pointed out above about new model introductions coming next year. I have never heard a young person even refer to an LexusLS as a car they would desire."" I also don't hear may your people refer to a Deville or a Seville as car they would desire. There is a better chance of a young one desiring a LexusLS over a Deville or Seville, for example.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1487(dude):My only trash of Cadillac came in it's styling. Not it's mechanic's or engineering or build. Again(since it evades you) styling is subjective. BTW, you have a propensity to trash Lexus as it is, so do not feel like nobody else can trash Cadillac, if you must consider my comments ""trashing"". Really, no really you never asked where I lived. I live on the east coast(NJ), so I do not know where you are living, but up here other than Limo companies owning Deville's, I don't see many. And NJ is a bit like California in that it is the land of expensive luxury imports. I don't know where you live but if you ride on up the NJ turnpike and stop off in towns like Cherry Hill, Morrestown, then Mercer county, Monmouth county, Bergen County, Short Hills, and on up thru Parsippany and so on, the roads are littered with Mercedes, BMW, Lexus, Jaguar, Audi. And of course alot of Cadillac also. But Caddy is definately not the ""bomb"" car you make it out to be. I can drive to Boston, lots of friends there, nobody is driving a Cadillac. ""I am telling you that Lexus makes few vehicles that are desirable to young people in my area based on what I see on the street and what I hear from my peers. I am younger than you and I do not find any of Lexus' models to be physically appealing."" Again, dude, you seem to consistently miss the point(s) I made. You, remember you, do not find Lexus' models appealing. But I can again say that you put a Lexus in front of the average young person and a Cadillac in front of the average young person and that average young person would rather have the Lexus. The Cadillac would be at the bottom of the list. When is the last time you went shopping for a Lexus that you know they charge high financing prices? ANd how is 0% financing not a incentive? Please, 0% IS a incentive to help blow out cars. I don't know what Lexus charges for interest rates, but if they are charging higher interest rates than what the average banks are charging, I would bet nobody would be leasing thru Lexus or 2) their sales wouldn't be growing every month. Sorry, I don't buy the $56K figure. 1) I see you can buy the car for basically invoice even in NJ 2) I can see you can buy it for basically invoice off of Carsdirect.com 3) I don't see a whole lot of DTS's because alot of the ones I see are owned by the Limo companies and they definately aren't DTS's. ""I cannot believe that you could honestly say that Infitni ranks higher than cadillac in terms of luxury status. that is not supported by sales numbers, nor technological achievements. "" Again since this is also eluding you, let me point it out. Where these cars rank was IMO. I know you are the master of where cars rank(and cadillac is the king of 1487's automotive luxury hierarchy). IMO means which car makes I would consider in order. Infiniti is primarily based on the G35. Much better car than the CTS in just about every way for less money. And it will run circles around a CTS. ""You say Gm as made these promises before, but you fail to mention that this promise is backed by confirmed products and $4 billion in capital."" Haven't they? All through the 90s? the STS was supposed to beat it's competitors from BMW, Mercedes, & Lexus in terms of quality, performance, and Luxury. Wasn't it? Has either generation of the STS from the 90s done that? What about the current CTS? From every comparison test I have read, it rates quite low. The XLR-has anyone driven a production version yet? I also think it will be a good car and it's the only good looking Cadillac I can see in the forseeable future, but really how many people do you think will pony up upwards of $70K for a Cadillac? $4 billion in capital means nothing if you can't EXECUTE. ""When are they going to step up and try to challenge BMW and MB car for car? "" I believe Lexus has more cars to compete with more of BMW & mercedes products that Cadillac does. Let's start, shall we? The IS300 competes with the BMW 3Series & MB C-class.THe ES300 competes with the BMW 3Series & C-classthe LExus GS300 competes with the 525i & 528i, E320The Lexus GS430 competes with the 540i, E430The Lexus LexusLS competes in between the BMW 5 & 7Series and Mercedes E & SClass but more towards the 7Series &SClassThe RX300 competes with the ML320, X5the LX470 competes with the ML430 X5 4.4i(kinda)What cars does Cadillac have that compete head to head in any category with Lexus, BMW, or Mercedes?Cadillac made fabulous claims that it would handle better than the 5Series, yet in every test I've seen, Cadillac doesn't seem to measure up to the 5Series. The Seville's competition is supposed to be the 5Series,EClass, and GS-series. The Deville competes with nothing from Benz, BMW, or Lexus. The Deville basically competes with the Town Car. And the Escalade is too large to compete with either the X5 or ML430.So, where is Cadillac's model for model competition to BMW, & Mercedes? ""Lexus is still beating us over the head with ""the relentless pursuit of perfection"" advertising and a lack of cohesive design strategy. When are they going to step up and try to challenge BMW and MB car for car? Truthfully, I dont think lexus cares about their reputation for performance or styling, they care about sales. As long as they are ahead in sales they arent going to truly challenge the benchmarks."" Bingo. Sales. Isn't that what Cadillac cares about also but can't seem to pull off, increased sales? What else do you think corporate america is about? selling fewer products? Challenging the benchmarks. Explain to me how Cadillac has challenged the benchmarks? Oh, I forget they haven't. Lexus builds the LexusLS which competes head to head with the SClass and 7Series-and according to people who drive it, it actually does compete with them. Can the Deville compete with the ls? Not the last time I checked. The GS430, in every comparison I've read, competes with the benchmark 540i. Does the Seville? The IS300 competes with the 3Series, and it actually even wins some comparison tests against the 3Series. Does the CTS? Lexus has challenged and continues to challenge BMW & mercedes. Cadillac has not in a long time. If you say they may challenge them in the few coming years, I could buy that. But saying they have challenged them or are currently challenging them is a farce. Cadillac doesn't have one product that is a benchmark or close to being a benchmark currently. -The CTS doesn't excel at anything whether it be luxury or performance. The ES300 does-at being a luxury car.-The Seville doesn't excel at anything either-it can't outperform a GS430, E500, or 540i. -The Deville can't touch theSClass, LexusLS, or 7Series in terms of performance or luxury.

"2400 units for the lsis right on the mark for a 30K annual figure. I doubt there is any cannibalization going on. They will sell around 30K units. They have been in the 30-36k range sInce 2001. Their original annual goal for the car was 25k units. I also doubt GS sales will slacken. If anything they will accelerate. .As for the LexusES - the two cars are night and day in looks, performance and price and it's hard to fathom they would attract the same buyer given those character and demographic differentiations. On top of that you can hardly make a case of cannibalization from one or two months worth of sales data anyway and you need to look a lot further than sales if you want to make a case. One place to start is checking the inventory days of the lsand LexusES vs one year ago. If they're static than it's a production issue. I guarantee you Lexus pushed production capacity in favor of the GS to meet its anticipated demand. I'm afraid you are reading far too much into this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"400-500K. Such high volumes will clearly dilute the Lexus brand equity so much so that it wont be a luxury brand anymore. It will be stretching the brand just too much. This will mean lexus outselling every asian brand except toyota, honda, nissan and hyundai. Instead lexus should focus on raising the prices of its offerings in line with germans. REVENUE = UNIT SALES X MSRP (OR TRANSACTION PRICE).So either increase the revenue by increasing the unit sales by flooding the market with low end LexusES and RX and diluting /damaging the brand or raise the prices, raise brand cachet while still increasing the revenue.

AND NOTE THE FOLLOWING: ""Dynamic control invasive if the car begins to oversteer. And the system cannot be disabled."" I wonder if germancarfans will knock this the way they knock the Lexus cars for this.2. Styling: I can't wait to see it in person to judge for myself. The wheel flares and trunk bulge still turn me off in the pics, especially in the light colors where the shadows exaggerate the design elements. Maybe I could live with it in real life? I'd hate to have to rule the car out just on a design, like I have had to do with the A8 based on its just too, too ugly nose. NOTE TO GERMANCARFANS: NOT MUCH WOOD ON THE DASH, BUT THERE IS ON THE STEERING WHEEL! Oh no, MB goes Lexus just where I dislike it the most....3. Reliability: Can you imagine trying to maintain this car once the warranty is over- even if MB's past problems are resolved? Scary....4. Pricing: Starting at $86K, and then adding $18K more in options! Ow. I don't suppose there will be a well-equipped SClass version for a lot less than that? But I guess MSRP (and to a lesser extent, long-term reliability)doesn't matter if you can lease it for no money down, $499/month for 36 months.

I have owned 3 different Lexus models in the last 5 years, and the reliability has been far superior to what I have experienced with MB cars, not to mention the dealer experience. However, I have not given up on MB. I recently replaced my RX300 with a new E320 wagon. If Lexus offered anything close to it, I would have gone with Lexus. (How about a GS300 wagon, Lexus?)

"A few points here Oac. A decade and a half, is all Lexus' history compared to the 100+ for MB, Audi and others... What do you expect ? Perfection ??? For its short lifespan, Lexus has achieved a level unheard of in automotive history. And the sky is the limit. The LexusES killed off every competition in its path. Ditto the RX, setting the bar for what a luxury car-based SUV should be. The LX continues its remarkable run on a solid LC platform, old as it is.... These are Lexus winners anyway you slice it.... Often times reading here about Lexus does imply that they are perfection, now they aren't? I'm confused. The LexusES killed off the Infiniti I35 and probably caused Acura to change directions with the TL in trying to take it from crusier to sports sedan. The LexusES has never done any ""killing"" when it comes to the German competition. None of them make a fwd push-mobile. The RX didn't kill off anyone, it has more competition than ever. I'll give you that it did ignite and show the way for the segment, but others haven't tried to duplicate it either. Most other SUVs in its space can still venture off-road while the RX remains a bad weather vehicle at best. The LX is outdated and was outdone years ago by the Range Rover. A Range Rover will do anything the LX can do off-road or even better and the Supercharged model blows the LX away in nearly every way possible. The LX continuing its remarkable run is another way of saying that Lexus really has neglected it. Talking of late to the party, how late was BMW and Audi to the SUV party ? How late are they to the hybrid party ? How late are they to the 8-speed tranny party ? How late are they to creating an ergonomic cupholder in their lux cruisers ? How late are they to simple, touchscreen DVD-based Nav ? Oh, don't tell me these things are unimportant, cos they are, otherwise MB, BMW and Audi won't have these in their cars as well. Good questions and more importantly valid until you get to the 8-speed tranny. I seem to remember that when Mercedes came to market with their 7-speed tranny it was seen as nothing special, but now we're supposed to get excited about an 8-Speed tranny? There is no 8-speed party going on because no one else has one nor would they have had time to develop once since the Lexus unit was just announced. No one else has a 7-speed automatic yet to match Mercedes so MB and Lexus are both slightly ahead of the game there. Audi is ahead of them all when it comes to their DSG tranny, when is Lexus going to put something like that in one of their sporty cars? I guess that upcoming GT/LF-A is their best shot at something like that? When it Lexus going to join the manual transmission party currently going on in the sports sedan market is a more pressing question? As to the SC, I am no fan but at only 13 days on dealer lot before it gets sold, its a winner for Lexus. The new GS came earlier than anticipated, with old carryover motors (4.3L V8), and a new but underpowered 245HP V6. Certainly Lexus looks to amend these with the GS350 and the GS450h. As to beating a 5Series, Lexus is NOT a performance-inclined company, thus far. Their forte is luxury, refinement, solid build quality and reliability.Thats easy to do when sales are dropping, you limit production and that keeps the car scarce. You're acting like Lexus is selling every SC430 that they can make, NOT. The GS story is one of denial now for most Lexus fans. After all the talk from Lexus about how it will rival the 5Series there has been nothing but apologies and excuses every since from Lexus fans as to why it hasn't done so. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A LexusLS a head turner? I've never heard that one before. Seriously though I drove the GS300 again this past Saturday, killing time while a friend closed a deal on a ES330. I was more impressed with it this time around, must have been the handling advantage of the ""G-Spider"" wheels and tire upgrade this one had. I still can't even begin to like the look though. The giant hatchback look and too much wheelbase make this a very ill-porportioned car to my eye. I hope they don't think this is the way to go with the next LexusLS. Now the IS appears to be a different story, can't wait to see it in person. Overall the GS is a curious piece. They seemed to have targeted the 5Series in sporty appeal, but stuck to their traditional roots in interior design. The seating position relative to the dashboard is pureEClass. The huge center console is anything but sporty, and looks like it belongs in a LexusLS. The whole car does have that cockpit feel that I like, its snug but not confining to me. Really like that. The back seat is tight, but the real problem I think for most is the fact you have to duck to avoid that low slung roof, because once inside I didn't have a problem with the actual room available. Finally the leather seemed really gritty to me, not the smooth stuff you all rave about so much?M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A review of car is a funny thing. One minute they are correct in every way and the next the reviewers don't know what they're talking, all depending on what they say about the car a person likes.

If were fortunate enough to actually be in this market I'd pick anEClass or A6 over the GS, and the M35/45 also over the GS300/430. Most likely. ""I believe a *high-end lux* car/truck is one with features and contents not found in pedestrian/mass-produced cars/trucks. Features like high-end audio (ML, Bose, etc), voice-activated Nav, radar/laser-CC, drive-by-wire, brake-by-wire, bluetooth, parking-assist, rear-camera, 5-/6-/7-speed tranny, cooled/heated seats, V8-powered or higher (no wimpy v6s, pls), state-of-the-art in safety gadgets, unparalleled quality and refinement, low NVH, good handling and performance, highly reliable, and best-in-class customer service.""I agree with this for the most part, but you can put these features on any car and it still doesn't always mean its a luxury car, imo. To me a luxury car is, yes a car that has features that regular cars don't have, but its the way all of this is intergrated that makes a luxury car. Also the quality of build, performance, styling and heritage make up the luxury car experience or defines what a luxury car is, again imo. So we're not that far apart here. To me (not anyone else here) I like the fact that Mercedes can make a taxi cab E240 and a E55 AMG out of the same basic car. I like the fact they can make an A-Class to compete with everyone else while a SL65 AMG mixes it up with Ferraris, Bentleys and Aston-Martins (see the March issue of CAR magazine). To me that is part of lure of Mercedes-Benz, to me. That an the fact that they aren't scared to introduce new technology. Now that brake by wire is present in EClass , Lexus has just done it for the GS. That says volumes to me, again it doesn't have to anyone else, I'm saying just to me. Mercedes' biggest problem is reliability and that has been said many times and many ways. Another thing while I'm crazy about Mercedes' cars they aren't my favorite in every segment either nor have I ever said they're the best in every segment, which is why I'm not exactly on the same page on every issue with the other German car defenders here. I give credit where it is due and I'm crazy about certain cars from everywhere, not just Germany. ""Which company sells the most cars/trucks north of $50K here in the US ?""Ahh...it certainly isn't Lexus. Between the cars that Lexus sells that are over 50K: LexusLS, LX470, GS430 and SC430 Lexus doesn't sell as manySClass, CL, SL, G, E500s, E55s, CLK500s, CLK55s and now CLS-Class cars (all of these being over 50K) that Mercedes does. If you're going to set the bar at 50k then its Mercedes, or at 60K, 70K, 80K. I think you'd have to go past 100K to find volume sales in another brand like Bentley maybe. Between 50K to 100K Mercedes sells more than anyone else. This is kinda my point when I see the sales ranting here, because Mercedes isn't priced like Lexus and yet they're expected to win a sales race. The have far more models over 50K than they do under 50K. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because all the action occured at the wrong end...this was the world's most powerful front-wheel-drive car...the tyres only escaped howling extinction because of the severely interventionist policy of the traction control system."" A Vauxhall spokeman said, ""It was the wrong car for the UK market, and there was no point in trying to continue...there is light at the end of the tunnel...if the new CTS does well in Europe, we might bring Cadillac back.""Wow!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Actually I did kinda like the RL back in 1996. I was there live at the Chicago Autoshow when the car was introduced. I've always liked Acuras more than Lexuses or Infinitis. Right now though Infiniti is the one tugging at me....that G35 Coupe in particular. maxhonda99, I agree totally with the latest survey. The Dependability survey is where Mercedes-Benz won't show any improvement for quite a while. This year's study is looking at 2001 models so I expected for Mercedes to do worse because of the SClass and C-Class of those years. Mercedes won't improve in the Dependability study until at least 2007-8 when the 2004-2005 models will be examined. They might do better in 2006 when the 2003 models are looked at but I wouldn't bet on it. brightness04, I no longer find your argument credible. Statements like this:""hat is a great MB marketting line. How many SClass vehicles was the S320 owner buying any way? Once the S320 was brought home and sitting in the garage, what other engine option did he have? I suppose every aspiring [non-permissible content removed] should be an A-class or C-class because with MB, you have the option of buying an SClass or even Maybach! What a joke""...throw common sense out the window. I think you know what I meant by what I said earlier. The person who didn't want a S320 had the option of buying a S420, SClass orSClass. I can't believe what you just stated. By this samd ridiculous logic, tell me what engine option did an RL buyer have in 1996 or now? Nothing. Zip. Same old 225hp V6 is the sole RL engine choice. RL buyers had no choice. Period. FYI, the S320 made up to 40 percent (during some years not over the entire model run) of SClass sales in this country. The S280 was not sold here. ""Thank you for agreeing with me. The RL, while not obsolete when introduced in 1996, is quite obsolete today, just like the 3.2 MB engine, not necessarily obsolete in the mid-90's, but quite obsolete today.Please tell me how in the real world driving is the E320's engine obsolete. Forget the technical aspects (which most buyers don't know squat about) and tell me why the E320's engine is so out of date. Due tell. Please site credible reviews in which such is stated, not your biased reports. ""here are two ways of segmenting market: by size and general vehicle characteristics/utility purpose, and by price alone. E320 is in the same segment as ES330 and TL in terms of vehicle utility purpose and amenity, namely, mid-size sedan with luxury interior appointment. The price difference just goes to show how non-competitive MB has become even as it cheapens the interior material.""I'm sorry but I find this to be a totally foolish statement. I wouldn't care what size the car is with a price difference that is in play between the E320 and ES330, they are not direct compeititors. The ES330 is cheaper because unlike Mercedes, the Lexus is at heart a heavily modified Camry underneath and that allows Toyota to spread the cost out more, and it is fwd, a much cheaper more pesdestrian layout. To ignore such fundamental differences shows where the logic is coming from. ljflx, Don't know about the 7, but the S is still more expensive than the average LexusLS, discount or not. Everyone isn't going to get the deal folks (i.e. informed buyers) get on Edmunds. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Actually it is pretty easy to compare the 7, S and LexusLS. They are different on price but if you load up the LexusLS then you are within $2-3k of an SClass with minor options and $5-6k of an SClass normally optioned. From your priority list the LexusLS is likely the car for you and the SClass is second. What you can't compare either a 7Series or the LexusLS to is the over the top S55amg. But otherwise the cars are very comparable.MB dealers - seemed fine to me when I shopped in NJ in 2001 but I'd go with an exclusive MB dealer and not one that shares a location with other car models. I shopped at a combo MB/Honda (one building, two showrooms) dealership and an MB exclusive dealership and preferred the latter. Every Lexus dealership I've dealt with in the NY/NJ area pampered you and treated you like royalty. I can't say anything about MB - other than comment on sales since I didn't buy and never dealt with the service dept. At Lexus you always get an RX or LexusES as a loaner in my experience. At the MB exclusive dealership I would have gotten a C-class and at the combo guy I would have gotten a car from Enterprise. Lastly - I didn't feel MB or Lexus dealers exerted any pressure on the sale. It was always your choice and the dealers praised their cars and the cars of the competing brands. But I was shopping new, not pre-owned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Actually the 7 is also . All three are 12-15% below last year. The A8 is +7% but we are only talking about 2400 cars sold in total there thru 5 months. The lsis on sched to sell about 30K cars and that is a good year. 2004 was an excellent sales year.Drivers left hand/arm straight out meant left turn. If it was flexed upward instead it meant right turn. It was before my time - predominantly a 50's and 60's thing. Some motorcycists still use the hand signals and giuys in old cars that you sometimes see on a saturday also do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Actually this is not a driver's car at all. If you own one of these cars you are suppose to have it chauffeur driven just like a limo. If you think about it, all Lexuses are rebadged Toyota.Toyota LexusWindom Es300/330Aristo Gs300/430Celsior ls/430Altezza IS300",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Actually you will see (at least I did) a lot more MB's than BMW's over there. But Lexus has its foot in the door at this point. Maybe it's the more cushy ride that gives MB the lead and will bring Lexus in. Interesting also was that the drivers of the service I was using (a very large one but the name escapes me) were recommending that the owner of the car service switch over to Lexus cars at the high end and keep VW's at the lower end of the spectrum. By the way my driver thought the oldEClass was a piece of garbage but that the new one was a marvelous car - and he had driven the new one. He also thought the LexusLS was one of the best riding cars he'd ever been in. While I was there I got to see one of the ""royalty"" RR's on the road leading into central London from Heathrow. Incredible how long it was and how high the roof line was. Definitely a highly customized RR. But it was empty.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Actually you're forgetting the S350. Mercedes has a $65K S with just 241hp and 248ft.lbs of torque. If the Lexus 4.3L is so weak and pathetic, why arent the German cars any faster? The lsweighs 3990lbs. The BMW weighs 4500lbs, the A8 is 4400lbs. Lexus doesnt need any more power, they just need to keep the weight down compared to the porky BMW and Audi. As for the VW, it weighs 1200lbs more than the Lexus. An LexusLS would have no trouble running away from a Phaeton at a stoplight, regardless of how much more power the W-8 has.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Actually, I thought the 3rd gen Lexus style was often described as *vanilla* or *boring*, never awful.... But the Bimmer style is just plain ugly, especially the bulbous trunk. That is different to being boring.... BTW, I don't agree that the lsstyle is boring at all. My 2nd gen style is very graceful and ages quite well. It remains a head turner despite its age. MBs are of course, much more elegant, no doubt, especially the current E- andSClass. I won't argue that MBs are better styled than Lexuses, but maybe the styling will improve for the lswith the L-Finesse direction. I guess we'll see when the 2007 lsis revealed...We already know what the 2007 S looks like; certainly a regression from current style, imo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Actually, with the lstaillight it seems Lexus is just repeating something they've done before. In 2000 they changed the taillight on the ES300 so that the orange portion became clear.Further, if memory serves correctly I believe it was Toyota that first used clear turn signals (instead of orange) on taillights back in 1988 with the Supra.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"after already having anSClassi wanted something that was not as long but just as wide on the inside. the S isn't available in the US in the swb but this year Audi did offer a swb A8. plus i really like the look inside and out of the A8. i did test drive the 7 and the lsbut the 7 was too visually complicated inside and out and the lsthe exact opposite. the A8 fell right between the two. there are horror stories for every brand. on a vw board there is a poster who just purchased an LexusLS a week ago and wants to dump it for a Phaeton. and it seems he is willing to take a big hit in resale value to do it. I've had 4 MB's...2 of the dreaded ML's and i didn't have the experience that ejerod had. these are the vehicles....00 E430, 02 S55, 00 ML430, 02 ML500. so it is not a ""crock"" that i feel the way i do toward MB, it is real world experience. as for surveys purposes. if you don't value your own real world experience over what CR's is selling you that is your choice. i wonder how many people who will believe what CR's sells as being 100% accurate will even ponder how manyvehicle surveys did they actually receive to justify that opinion? like i said in an earlierpost...Audi did quite well in CR's survey. big deal. i don't need CR's or JDpowers to be in agreement with me. IMO it is an irrational fear that just because the car i drive isn't on the top of some surveys list it is not manufactured with quality and care.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After seeing the new GS in person both in Detroit and Chicago I thought it was a knockout. I agree with your cousin. Photos do not show all of the unique creases and shapes of the GS sheetmetal, especially the front end. I definitely feel the GS needs to be seen in person to be appreciated.That said, my mother will be trading in her 1999 GS 300 on the new one. The dealer told us it goes on sale March 1, 2005, and she'll be looking to get one around September 2005.How's the new ls?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Again, I have to disagree. While you've had problems with your recent cars, you are definitely the exception. Both my '01 lsand my wife's '01 RX have been perfect. If your CPO car was stalling, it sounds like they sold you a lemon. I do agree that your Lexus dealer is perhaps not the greatest. I really have to disagree about the interiors though. Look at the following pictures.http://photos.ebizautos.com/4810/915452_16.jpghttp://i1.ebayimg.com/03/i/06/8c/53/d9_12.JPGhttp://www.carauctionhelper.com/~worldwidemotor/T0116012-9sm.jpgAt a glance, which car are they from? In the early '90s, Lexus came up with one interior design, which they copied and pastied with very slightly different switchgear into each car. They were almost entirely plastic and vinyl, and not even on the same planet as the entry level ES350 in terms of design and quality.http://shows.autospies.com/gallery/AS/es350-interior-vegas-lg/cl.jpg?undefined",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Agree on the NAV, my wife's RX and my lsand XK all have it. One of the reasons I bought an XKR was because the NAV system is standard on the R, and I wouldnt have to hunt for an XK8 with the option. The Jag's system isnt nearly as comprehensive as the Lexus (technically Acura was first with NAV in the RL back in '96, but IMO Lexus does it better than everyone else) but it gets the Job done when I need it to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Agree. The old 7 was only a 12-14K a year seller and never sold over 18K. The new one was over 20K in year one. I'm not sure who the new 7 hurt. The lssales grew and the S and Jag held very well. Maybe the market expanded. I think the A8 - still a real low seller but up a lot from last year - cut into 7 sales this year. The Phaeton seems like a car without a country.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Agreed. Very few cars have that super-vault feel of the S. This has been a signature for the S for many years, especially with the start of the '92 model, with it's larger than life size and near tank-like solid feel.With Audi, the way they put so much quality and precision in the A6 does in fact leave little to want in the A8. But the A8 does offer plenty of things that you can't get in the A6.And I can understand why you said you feel like a limo driver. The A8L's cabin is HUGE! The rear seat is the biggest in the segment and it is so far away from the driver that you do get that ""chauffered"" feel. But what I've heard about the new LS460L, this will indeed be a limo, with a massive 214"" of length. I'm anticipating this car just like everyone else. So if you could wait a few months, you'll probably have more cars to choose.I saw where you mentioned that if MB brought the S450 over, then you'd consider it. I think that they may just do so when the lsdrops this fall..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ah, so you are willing to accept IIHS data now?2 points:1. The full study, if you look at it http://www.iihs.org/srpdfs/sr4003.pdf only included one Lexus vehicle, the RX, which by the way ranked as safer than theSClass, though not as safe as the E. (Not bad for a vehicle with a higher center of gravity than either the S or E.) So the study you tout hardly proves that MB is safer than Lexus, or that the S is safer than the LexusLS. 2. Since you accept IIHS data now, why don't you take a look at this:http://www.iihs.org/vehicle_ratings/ictl/ictl_lux.htm . That data...from the same source you just touted...shows that the lshas lower injury rates than the S. In fact it shows that the lsis the safest luxury sedan, period (though if you include station wagons it gets beat by Audi).So, which is safer in the real world, again?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But if its important to you, thankfully I have real uppity friends with nice rides.... YES, I have driven MBs many many times.... Maybe you forgot my mention of my good buddy who's got an SClass and a 7Series , and was looking to buy an LexusLS. Well, he lets me drive his German cars plenty... He and I competed on SUVs.. He bought an Escallade, while I went with the LX470... Lets say we have a healthy rivalry....

"All I can say is that you're lost when comparing the 48K+EClass to the 33K ES330 in any way, especially in sales because they're both mid-size cars. That is totally and utterly ridiculous and really says that you have no sense of the market. The RL is priced like EClass at 45K and this is at the very least more comparable in terms of sales. ?""Do you need reviews to tell you how to open a box of cereal and how to pour milk? Go test drive one against its competitions yourself. Even if you are too lazy to do that, the numbers should tell you the difference:You listing the stats for each car doesn't prove of say squat about how they drive, especially compared to a fwd tarted up Camry which you've foolishly tried to compare EClass with. You seem to be good at crunching numbers like other Lexi folk, but beyond that you seem lost. If don't care to understand the difference between fwd and rwd dynamics then that is your problem. Whats really amazing is that you'd give the hp/torque ratios for a car without a sporting weld in it's body, the ES330. The group that buys this car isn't concerned with even feeling the road much less actually drivin'. BTW, I've driven every car you've list except the new 530i. Been there and done that. If you thinkSClasses are mainly chauffered then you're mistaken to say the least. The Maybach was just created and is meant for just that, and that has what to do with the 118 years beforehand when Mercedes was making their name? Mercedes are not about isolation now nor were they in the past. The SClass and Maybach are about the only Benz products you'll find Jeeves driving. TheSClassAMG and regular SClass/S430 surely aren't chaufrered. ""Do you need reviews to tell you how to open a box of cereal and how to pour milk?"" (had to post this one twice)Nope, but I need a credible review to back up your baseless theories about these cars. Even some within the Lexus camp don't buy this crap about the E320. Also, I find your explanation about Lexus' GS to be the biggest, fattest, excuse made on this board in about a year. Low production, this and that, face it the car is old and tired and has never sold well past 1998. Excuses, excuses. You mean to tell me they're redesigning it for it sell at the same rate?!?!. Please. Oh, and just because you think Mercedes' image was made by the SClass doesn't make it so. Yes it is a very important car, their most important sedan as far as image/prestige/engineering goes, but the SClass is also a Mercedes-Benz legend and a even bigger one than theSClass. Poof there goes another one of your theories. Tell me the SClass is about isolation. EClass dates back for a similar amount of time and has never been about ""isolation"" or the back seat. Nobody is saying Mercedes is sporty like BMW, but traditionally a Mercedes was only second to them in this aspect, until the Japanese (not Lexus) made their run on BMW and surpassed Mercedes in the sport department. AMG has been around since 1967 and is also part of the MB legend. A Mercedes was always a road-worthy car, and they never prided themselves on isolation like Cadillac, Linc and now Lexus. You seemed to be confused about isolation and comfort. A Mercedes has always been a fine compromise between comfort and dynamics like a Jaguar, not a rolling isolations chamber like Caddy and Linc (used to be) and Lexus' 38K Camry. Why don't you read up on the Maybach and SClass then post. These cars are not about total isolation, but simply a blend of comfort and roadability. They most definitely are about ""driving pleasure"", with 493hp and active suspension is more fun than the current LexusLS will ever be. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All I see on these boards are discussions about BMW, MB and the LexusLS. How come no ones likes the A8. I have been researching all these cars and from what I have read, the Audi is one of the best cars in its class. In a lot of reviews it has been even better than the almost perfect LexusLS. Do most of you'll not like it just cause its name is not as big as the other three or are there some faults with it that I am not aware off? ?The A8 also has the most HP amongst all these cars and a superior interior than the other three IMO.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All of that is pretty much wild speculation on your part about Cadillac. When Cadillac actually builds an SL55 or M5 killer I'll be one of the first to (grudgingly) admit it. Mercedes has no rivals in the current hp war going on in Germany/Europe, at least among the luxury car makers. Cadillac is about 200hp short already compared to Mercedes biggest hi-po offerings. designman, Nothing will help the ls's styling. The 2004 facelift made the car look worse to me, especially in the front. It looks like someone just tacked the grille on afterwards. It is as homely a car there ever was that cost so much, imo. The W140 looked better when it was introduced. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All this talk about different cars from different countries has me thinking about how each nation goes about building what they think is the ideal luxury/performance machine. The Italians go for three things IMO, looks, handling, and sound. I see LG and Designman have touched on this. Proof of this is the recent comparo at C&D between the 911 Turbo, F430 and Z06. The Z06 beats them both in nearly all the measurements of performance, yet it came in last and slowest of the 3, the Ferrari came in first. That is simply called charisma. Nothing sounds, looks or goes like an Italian car, even when they aren't the fastest in instrumented testing, they apparently feel and more importantly sound like they are! Nothing looks or sounds like a Lamborghini or Ferrari to their owners even when they're being passed on the highway by a mere ""Chevy"". I won't even bring up the huge cottage industry the Italians have going on with sports cars like the Zonda. This lineage and heritage is what makes a car like Quattroporte Sport GT so irresistible to those who drive/own them. Just take a look in the Quattroporte thread and you'll see what I mean. There is an immediate sense of thrill and adventure and come what may attitude with the car as long as they get to enjoy it. Only old-time British car owners from the dark periods truly understand this disposition. Many German car owners have bailed on this point. Germans go for cold efficiency and technical brilliance and superior/detailed construction. This makes them juggernaughts on the road, but next to Italian cars they come off ""soulless"" by many accounts. The 911 Turbo, a car with its engine in the rear and a shape that could only be pulled off by years of conditioning rich folks to accept it, is for all intent and purposes is a something a German rocket scientist would come up with. Cold, brutal, efficient performance during which form must follow function. The British are similar to Italians in regards to going for how a car looks, sounds, and smells. Jaguar, Bentley, Rolls-Royce and Aston-Martin all share these elements. The difference here is that while an Audi A8 or SClass may be better ""put together"", their leather and especially wood work isn't lovingly wrought as say a Bentley or Aston-Martin. The British are somewhat the opposite of the Germans in another regard also, they'll stick wood and leather anywhere they please, function be damned. This creates charming if sometimes ergonomically flawed interiors that stun passengers, but at the same time would infuriate a driver coming from say a Japanese car to a Bentley or Aston-Martin. The British are pretty skilled with a V12s too. One area where the British and Italians soundly whop the Germans is in the area of customization. For example, take a look at the Bentley or Maserati websites. The level of details that can be specified is mind boggling. I mean you can choose the color of the seatbelts for goodness sake! German, Japanese and American car company bean counters would drop dead at such a suggestion. The Japanese are similar to the Germans in the way that they typically, but not always put function before form. Their problem has been that the &#147;form&#148; end of that hasn&#146;t come out to well. They also bring the whole reliability, ease of use game to the table, which has proven to be quite successful for Lexus in particular. The Japanese still miss out on a lot of the finer points when it comes to what makes European cars in general so desirable, but they&#146;re attempting to make up for that with a more trouble free ownership experience. This works, but it has limits. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All I can say is go look at the SClass and SLK, they are very different, ditto for the CLK and CL. There is no way these cars are twins, they don't even share the same platforms, only one with no experience with either would say something like that. Sure they all carry the MB theme, but they're very much different cars. If you see them both regularly you should know they don't affect each others sales. I'm willing to bet that if you drove the current SLK and SClass you'd see that the SLK doesn't even compare. Saying the SClass and SLK are twins are like saying the IS300 and GS300 are twins, or the lsand LexusES....similar cars sure, but different in execution. You're right about VW and Audi, they're insanely planning for Audi and VW to go model for model at the upper reaches, while it will produce some interesting cars, it doesn't make sense. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Amazing the agreement you'll get when you say that the Germans have done most of the copying. Way to go, now the Lexus guys are going to say that the SClass is a knockoff of a Bentley to excuse the LexusLS I guess. I truly hate to disagree with you on design because usually you're right on the money, but there is no way I can go for this. The Japanese will copy any and everything that is a success and something things that aren't. Mazda's original Miata was the most shameless Lotus Elan copy the world had ever seen. I mean the car was an exact duplicate. It took a German brand 15 more years to do something even close to that, VW's Jetta. I don't ever recall MB/BMW/Audi ever copying an enitre body from anyone, especially the Japanese in the way Lexus did with the ls/W140SClass. The difference with the above pics is that no one is going to mistake a Benz for a Bentley or a Acura for a Benz. Why? Because though their butts may be similar they aren't whole body style copies like the LexusLS is compared to the W140SClass. That is where similarities end between what the German automotive industry has done regarding design vs the Japanese. The Japanese take whole bodies and clone them while others (including the Germans) take an single trait or theme and run with it, in some cases. Big, big difference. In looking at those pics of the Bentley its rear isn't even the same as the other cars because the trunklid doesn't sit on top of the bodywork clamshell style like on the Maybach andSClass. All manufacturers have not copied each other either. IMO, that is nothing more than an excuse to excuse the Japanese from their cluelessness of design and need to copy everyone else. Mercedes, BMW, Audis and Jaguars are distinctive cars known the world over and it would all but impossible to confuse one for the other. You put a LexusLS next to a 1999 SClass and the to the uninitiated the two cars looks more alike than any BMW looks like any Mercedes or any Mercedes looks like a Bentley or Audi, not matter what their butts look like. Whats even worse is that now you have the Koreans who will copy any and everything they can. They've copied Mercedes' grille, the Lexus RX , Mercedes ML and countless other European designs. Wait, it gets worse...you have the Japanase copying the Japanese also. Look at a Mazda 6 and a Acura TSX, check out their grilles. Ridiculous. This inbred copying is why the Lexus GS and Maxima have been called twins. Sorry, but the there no way the German makes have ever taken copying to such a level as the Japanese and now Koreans. The German cars for better or worse are still far more original and distinctive than Asian cars. There is no comparison to the level of copying the Japanese have done over the years. If there is one thing the Japanese have a bigger legacy than the Germans, it is in the art of copying...something the German can't even begin to match. First the Aston-Martin incident and now this? What is going on designman? :confuse: M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Amazing, you completely ignored everything that was previously posted. Did you even look at the model/price chart? Obviously not. A CLK is not a SL, and everyone that wants a SClass does not buy or even want a CLK. Unlike the SC430 which tries unsuccessfully to be a 4-seat (who can sit back there) and a compete with 2-seaters, Mercedes has true 2-seat and true 4-seat convertibles. You could buy a C320 instead of a SClass too, that isn't the point. The point is where the cars line up, you know the ones that are supposed to be compared. EClass and the CLK do compete with the lsand SC, to a degree, especially with the E vs the LexusLS, the lsis clearly ""more"" car for the money. If were to even mention sales of EClass compared to the LexusLS you bring up price and class in a heartbeat. The cars are in small, medium, and large. C/ES/IS, GS/E, LS/S, the prices are higher for the MB in every case except the base C230 vs the IS300 and ES330. The CLK/SC/SL could all compete, sure. You're just reaching for things now, but in the end Mercedes' cars still cost a lot more. Buying a different Mercedes still doesn't take away the fact that MB has those higher priced cars. If everyone thought like that nothing above 70K would sell at Mercedes-Benz. They sell EVEN LESS cars overall, which illustrates my point. Price hinders sales. ""MB&#146;s low end starts 13% LOWER than Lexus&#146;.""When are you going to look at the entire range from Mercedes and Lexus side by side, instead of just the bottom end? Mercedes has at least 8 cars that start above any Lexus, that more than cancels out the 3 models that start below Lexus'. You are flat out ignoring where the bulk of Merceds' cars are priced. TheCClass is only ONE MODEL RANGE. Look at where the other start/end at. You're pretending those upper end MBs don't exists. The only market needs Lexus is serving better than Mercedes is the SUV market's needs. In cars they don't offer nearly the choices. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"An article in tomorrow's NYT...it is in print but not on the web yet so I can't link to it...is quite negative on the mpg achieved by the rx400h. Basically it suggests that based on the reporter's testing of a rx400h and RX , there is essentially no mpg benefit.Contrast that to a WSJ article from a couple weeks ago:The Lexus 400h was the most expensive vehicle we tested, but also the quietest. We drove it from Detroit to the tip of Michigan's thumb, mostly on state highways, clocking just over its EPA highway estimate of 27 mpg. To give it a little stop-and-go traffic, which is where the Toyota hybrid systems excel, we also endured downtown Detroit rush-hour traffic. In those six miles, the Lexus averaged 34.9 mpg, well above its 31 mpg city figure from the EPA Basically I think that if a reporter wants a ""story"" they'll end up driving either very wastefully or very frugally, and can make the mpg come out either low or high.I am still waiting to see a good test. What I have in mind is a large number of miles driven ""nose to tail""...meaning a rx400h and a RX , with one tailgating the other, and occaisionally switching positions or drivers. And also making sure that the 400h begins and ends the test with the same level of battery energy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"And about this ridiculous BMW vs. lexus thing. You know(and so does everyone else) that in terms of ride, handling, theSClass, 7Series, A8, Jag XJ, LexusLS are all very similar. I mean they all handle really well for their size and all stop well, and all ride well, and all are extremely quiet. The difference's are small, such as the LexusLS handles a bit worse and rides a bit better and the 7Series handles a bit better and rides a bit worse. As for livinbmw, I believe as someone else pointed out before, he is just simply here to light a fire! Maybe he's unemployed and has nothing better to do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"And you don't think that same feeling exists in a Lexus, specifically the ls?? ?Designman - Re last nights comment - I would tend to agree with your comment if you narrowed it from German cars to BMW's. I know people that won't ever go near an MB or Audi again. Never met anyone who said that about a BMW. Friends warned us to stay away from the 7 in the late 90's because they had some bad experiences and knew my wife and I would never put up with the problems they did. Yet they stayed BMW in cars although they did bring in the LX and RX from Lexus as SUV's. That's what is always so funny about this - so many multiple brand owners exist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"AnEClass is not that much smaller than an LexusLS. Really, if I had $60K, I wouldn't be ""buying up"" to the largest size possible. I'd buy EClass , because to me, the rear seat space beyond a certain point is just overkill. This would especially hold true if I lived in a large city. The lsis entirely too ungainly, as is the S and 7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Another thing, 2000 lss with about 20K to 30K more miles are selling for $1K more than 2000 A6 4.2 Quattros. And remember a 2000 LexusLS was cheaper than the average 2001 LexusLS. So yes, the A6's resale value is not the best, in fact the BMW 5Series holds it's value better, so does EClass , and so does the LexusLS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Traded the 97 A8 in on a 99 A6 2.8, traded that on a 2000 A6 4.2, then on a 2001 A6 4.2 and November of this year traded the A6 4.2 in on an 03 allroad.The 2001 A6 4.2 -- all possible options except CD changer IS still avail at my dealership (36K miles on it).e-mail me and I'll give you the salespersons name, etc.Generally I get rid of my cars before 40K miles -- the allroad MAY make me change my mind, especially if they cancel the car as of 2004. I got the allroad with a 36 month lease, most of the other cars were 30 months or less (the 99 A6 had a 12 month lease).The A8 was a very nice car, but it had a 5spd NON-tiptronic transmission, pearl white, all options (at the time) and Plus tires (245 45 17 PZeros) -- hard to believe a car as big as an A8 could run (in my opinion) pretty well with my 2001 A6 4.2 with sport suspension option. Of course the 2001 A6 did in many ways rival the 1997 A8 (remember the 97 A8 was NOT the long wheelbase).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"arcoates: AutoWorld Weekly did a comparison test in their Feb27 issue between the BMW 7Series L, MercedesSClass, Jaguar XJL and the LexusLS in which the BMW came out on top, followed only a half point behind by the Lexus, which they described as having ""best in class"" fit and finish and ergonomics and a strong engine (it was the quickest of the four). The Mercedes came in third (criticized for its weak engine, transmission, interior ergonomics and interior materials), and the Jaguar a distant fourth (although they loved the style and cache of both the brand and the car).pablo: You've never impressed me as being unreasonable, so I don't know what you've said to provoke some of the people here; that said, your comment that ""Mercedes' reputation for durability doesn't come from nowhere...Lexus has a while to go until it establishes such a long-lived track record"" is partly true -- Mercedes had a reputation for years as the most durable car on the planet, until Lexus raised the bar with their very first LexusLS. It's been over ten years now, which I think is more than adequate time to establish the validity of people's perceptions about Lexus quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Around here you'll see LX470's, TLC's and the latest rage - the GX470 paired up with just about any lux car - quite often. More often than not you'll see a Lexus SUV with a Lexus lux sedan - usually the LexusLS or LexusLS. But several people have SClass's paired with LX470's and TLC's. What's the man's car - an LX470 or an SClass? Neither. The truth of the matter is the cars are well shared and driven by both the husband and the wife. What is becoming popular - at least around here - is the RX as a third car doing duty for husband, wife and first generation child who recently got a license. The suv that blossomed and died so quickly is the M-class. It's hard to even find one around here these days. For whatever reason - BMW's - save the 3Series are just not all that popular where I am despite several BMW dealesr nearby. There's even one guy who has both an SClass and an LexusLS - but I don't know him. Thought it was someone visiting at first but I've seen them both about a dozen times on his driveway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a Lexus owner, I ran out and bought the new CR. I drive a Best Pick!! Maybe I can buy a decal for my RX announcing how smart I am...sv7887...Sometimes I do wish that the autos were simpler. I really liked my 1992 Q45 because of its uncluttered dash and relative simplicity. I don't recall having any problems during my 24 month lease. On the other hand, I enjoyed all the gadgets on my LexusLS and RX and haven't experienced any problems with them.merc1...Wouldn't you really rather drive a Buick?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As far as Lexus cars looking alike, if you look at the cars, in profile, they definitely look much different from each other. The GS has a more rounded profile. The IS is full of particularly sharp styling cues, and is heavily starched, without becoming an Acura TL. The lsfalls in between. So I'm not seeing it either, Merc. A crease here or there, but that's it. I like the GS the least (but it is acceptable), I like the IS the most, and the lsis great because it is a quantum leap from where it was, and it's competition has fallen off the table. If anything, Mercedes is now cultivating a image of plagirism, with the SClass taking on wheel humps, the Maybachs' rear end, the Accord's headlights, and the 7's dash. And the ML has obviously learned quite a bit from the original RX300. All I have to say about the Camry is it has many cues from the Corolla/Yaris/Avalon. It is not my cup of tea. When the '92 Camry came out, yeah, that was obviously a descendant of the LexusLS. Those days are over. If you can find anything in the Camry exterior that says 2007 LexusLS, good luck! The Camry interior does shares a similar overall theme, though. DrFill",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The luxury aspect, we all know will be a home-run.I will definitely be checking it out when it hits the showrooms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As I said before, v12 driver, many things are innovated by many companies at the same time. Adaptive cruise control is not just a mercedes innovation. Long before Lexus even introduced adaptive cruise, dateline on NBC showed Toyota testing adaptive cruise. That was several years before the LexusLS ever hit the streets. I never stated Mercedes hasn't innovated. They are clearly the leaders in innovation. But as with most Mercedes fans, you also make it out as only Mercedes innovating. Where do all the electronics innovations come from? That is typically Japan. As I said before, the technology that goes into building a Lexus, Mercedes or BMW can't match. And it shows in many areas. I'm sure just like a typical German car fan, you'll say JD power's and Consumer's Reports are biased or their testing is flawed. But realistically it speaks volume about how well about the technology that goes into every Lexus product. Also who had Nav systems in cars long before Mercedes? TOyota had them years before Mercedes did. And when Mercedes was still lugging around with archaic stereo systems with paper speakers and crappy sound quality, lexus was designing a ground breaking stereo system with Nakamichi. Let's move on to the 1995 LexusLS being the first car to have front seats with it's own suspension system. Or the innovative climate control system of the 1995 LexusLS. Let's not forget a innovation Mercedes still can't seem to muster, a in-dash CD changer. Quiet-can anyone make a car as quiet as a Lexus? If you don't think this is constant innovation, you're kidding yourself. To make a car quiet takes alot more than just packing the car with foam & weight. I had a 88 BenzSClass. It was a very good car. It was extremely reliable up to 100K miles. I was very happy with it. But the newEClass(in 2000) and SClass were simply outclassed by the LexusLS. Yes, the SClass has slightly better handling and more features but it also costs about $20 grand more. EClass costs a about the same as the 2000 LexusLS but with less feature content. And luxury. And both Benz's had subpar interior quality. The plastic, leather, & vinyl in both of these cars felt cheaper than my 88 420SEL. As for handling, as I said, the SClass is slightly better and ultimately that doesn't cut it. Especially considering I spend 70% of my time in traffic and the rest lugging the family around. Who has time to be Mario Andretti? As the name suggests, it's a Luxury car and luxury is the top priority for the average luxury car buyer. How many SClass customers do you think buy a SClass for it's handling? I can guarantee very few.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As I said you obviously need to feel good about your purchase. I won't even begin to knock anSClass, it's a great car reliability problems and all. Superior to an LexusLS - not in my book. They are pretty much equals. The E vs ls- Everyone I know who plays in this league shops the lsvs the S for a very simple reason - size of car. I looked at the E a few years ago and dismissed it immediately because of its size. I honestly never realized how small it was. I wouldn't buy it anymore than I'd buy an ES300 because I could'nt fit my family into it comfortably.NYbanker - agree - but I've never driven more than 110mph in my life - and when i did that speed it was in a 1995 LexusLS which handled it with ease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As I've said before, Lexus is at a crossroads, in particular with the LexusLS. Didn't say Lexus IS DUMB, or has been dumb. If they access the market as it is now, as opposed to looking at it as if it is 1993, they will see the market is ready for Lexus to move up. Especially the LexusLS. I think they have found this out, but I will take it as a sign of fear if it costs less than A8/7Series. The SClass has always been the standard lexus has judged themselves against. So it is time to show and prove! The SClass isn't overpriced because sales have virtually doubled, without the new lsto check it. A $70k start price will not affect sales numbers much, but will increases profit margins greatly, along with the brands image. And THEN the S will seem overpriced. DrFill",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Am I reading those figures correctly? You mean to tell me that a Lexus actually had a sales drop. Oh my. The Lexus sales machine never stops. Never. Expect those numbers to be spun into the positive somehow. Seriously though and in fairness I hardly see a GS taking away sales of the LexusES, with the LexusES being the ultimate blue-hair set ride. If that is truly the case then Lexus really didn't make the GS sporty at all because people I know that have and/or like the LexusES are as far removed from ""driving"" as possible. It would a truly awful endorsement of the GS (purpose and image wise) for the LexusES crowd to like the GS. That would mean the GS isn't a drivers car at all!! We all know the current IS300 was way past dead even before the new model made the magazine/auto show rounds. Even the few people interested in the current IS probably won't buy it now because the new model has been shown. The GS430 might take a LexusLS sale here and there, that is definitely possible because of their relatively close sticker prices. I'm sure ole Lexy will fixt this for 2007 with the new lsbeing taken of the 60K mark in base form. Also, I can't see Lexus repeating the 1998-2005 GS neglect again. They've already stated that BMW (again) is also the target as far as staggering engine introductions to keep the GS fresh. The German brands have done this since day one, but it took ""Lexis"" a while to catch on. Expect a GS350 and GS460 for 2007 which should give them some added buzz, but they'll have to keep the intro seperate from the new lsof the same year. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As it stands of now, Caddy's lineup makes Lexus look ""bad"". The CTS(especially the V) continues to be successful, and the glorified Escalade runs circles around the LX in terms of technology and sales(for the same money interestingly), and the STS V8 is a better performer than the GS430(dare I even mention the STS-v?). And pound for pound, I don't rate the current LexusLS any higher than a DTS, despite the FWD, it too is just a cruiser, something that it's fine doing and not posing as anything else. Oh, how I wish you would think these posts through before dropping them like 3rd period French! You seem impressed by CTS sales, but it is behind ES330/350 sales, and will always be. Having sat in a CTS (but refusing to soil my palate drivind one), anyone who would buy that over an LexusES deserves the resale value! The Escalade competes with the GX and the LX, and I haven't seen anyone shame the GX in anything. The 'Slade may be fast, but get a power tilt wheel and some Auto-up windows before you come knocking on that door! Both are better off-road, and more luxurious. Didn't the 'Slade just lose another comparison to the Mercedes GL? The Deville? You said a mouth full when you said ""pound-for-pound""! The last time eye sore it compared to the leaders, I think a Volvo beat it out for drivability and appeal. Should I call that post a rough draft of what you really wanted to say? If Audi can't knock on Lexus' door, you KNOW Caddy will keep walkin'! So Cadillac is your horse now? Just going around the 2nd-tier this week? Audi is good! Don't bail so fast! They'll be alright.

"At $69k (the estimated price C&D put on the car, which they thought might be low) the Phaeton is not worth it. Plus it is a very heavy car. I'd buy an a8 long before I'd ever consider a Phaeton. They aren't going to cut it here in my opinion and I still am missing VW's whole strategy. The US market is not big enough at this scale. You already have two exceptional softer riding cars in the S and lsand buyers are fiercely loyal to both. Then you have the more sport handlers in the 7 and the a8 (though it doesn't seem Audi is in BMW's league on performance in the big sedan from what I have read). Then of course you have Infinit and Cadillac waiting to pounce as well with far better buyer confidence and acceptance than VW. Plus they have whole lines of cars whereas the Phaeton is an oddball in VW's lineup. I hope their strategy isn't to be have a softer contra-Audi car at each level. They will get crushed. If they want to have a chance they have to make the type of direct strike Lexus made in 1990 and then roll out more models right away. But if they do that then you have to wonder why Audi is here. I just don't get it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At first I thought that the forum had suffered a horrible breakdown in communication. But after careful consideration, steve, I now understand you.Dear Lexus, My name is Steve Kilburn. I know that you are not charging enough money for your lsline of vehicles. I want to pay more and I want everyone else that buys one to pay more. It bothers me that they might be considered ""VALUE""-priced vehicles in the HELM category, because I want them to be considered ""PREMIUM""-priced vehicles in that category. I insist that you price them as they SHOULD be, in line with the 7Series BMW and the A8 Audi. You must do this NOW while the opportunity is there. Do not STUNT the LexusLS. Go for BIGGER PROFITS and do it NOW, otherwise you are selling your vehicles CUT-RATE. If you believe in CAPITALISM you will raise your prices to the level I have commanded you and you will do it NOW. Make sure you do not undercut your competition. Any changes that these price increases might make to the demand for your vehicles is of no concern because you can always use your FLEXIBLE manufacturing techniques. And remember to always consult first with BMW and Audi so that you set your prices in line with theirs because I have personally selected them to be the barometer for your price structure from now on. That's ALL I'm saying. That's all I've been saying all along.Oh . . . by the way . . . you really SHOULD stop building those HIPPO Lexus SUV's that are sucking all the earth's resources away and are nothing but rolling TERRORISTS. Maybe their drivers should live in a land fill for a week.My credentials are impressive as I work for a drug company and NEVER take any of the products myself, but I'd swear that there is someone smoking crack on the forum, and I think that it may be the same person that accused me of stealing my own stuff.Also, I want you to find out who the CLEVER person was that broke into my house and implanted that transmitter in my brain that makes me think and say things that I can not control.Sincerely your best consultant you ever had but never asked for,Steve KilburnYou see, steve, I told you I understand you now.

"Audi, would I call it a HELM? UMM.., YEAH!!The A8 has all the beans and more of what it takes to compete in this arena. Sales or no, the A8 is a very key player.Now Acura- If they won't build a legit(not a V-6 FWD-biased car off of an Accord platform) full-sizer with a RWD/V8, then they can fuggitaboutit. While nice and a pleasure to drive, the RL is way out of the realm, especially with it's $50k asking price which gets you into a V8-equipped M45, speaking of Infiniti...When the Q45 came out in it's 3rd iteration, the marketing was DOA. Why would you market a HELM just for having the brightest HID lights in the world? In this crowded field, it takes a bunch more than that to be a viable player. Infiniti is in a pivitol moment now, and it has to decide to either revitalize the Q-Ship or abandon it, and the rest of the line is enjoying the benefit of redo's/refreshes, why can't the most costly car reak the same benefit?Caddy, with the exception of the glorified Escalade and the super-powerful (and probably best kept secret in super-sedans) the STS-v and the all to fun CTS-v, the maker, while on a good path, has to do more. I think there are a lot of people that are growing tired of the ""Art & Science"" styling. They'll definetely have to take the DTS upmarket(and RWD Sigma-platform please) to compete with the big boys and not granny's other favorite, the Buicklexus.As you know, I'm a huge Audiphile. The company is blazen with technology and is usually one of the first ot introduce new innovations to the market.

"As ljflx pointed out Lexus has switched their emphasis over to their cars right in the nick of time because without the new LexusES and IS they'd be looking an YTD sales loss for the first time in many years. Their long-running SUV sales juggernaught is dying fast. That said, you can't stick Toyota at either end. While Ford, GM and now even Chrysler all post sales losses, Toyota posts huge gains based in part on their new smaller more efficient cars having found traction in the market. How brilliant this company is to be able to adapt so fast to changing preferences. If GM in particular can't keep the new full-size SUVs selling at a good clip until the end of the year they're in even more serious trouble, IMO. That was the gamble, bread and butter SUVs before the next generation of RWD cars. Is it me or is the Hyundai Sonata blatantly ""similar"" to the previous generation A6 in its overall shape and lines? It and the new Camry SE are some surprise lookers from the Asian corner in their respective segments. Mercedes-Benz is also having a sales party of their own. Sales up 21 percent in May 2006 compared to May 2006. The new GL is a hit if early sales are anything to go by. The E,SLK, and SClass are also pulling their weight. They're giving away 06' E's ahead of the 07's landing at the end of the month. The only fly in the buttermilk is the R-Class, the only one not living up to projections. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bangle has too much blame and credit for his designs. BMW should be applauded for their great sense of proportions and presence, as epitomized by the handsome and toned down 7Series. Ultimately, style does have its limits especially when a $100k car is stuck in traffic as all the others. Cars have no ""soul."" People do. The hyperbole lavished upon any vehicle is part marketing, part tradition, part experience, and at the end of the day purely up to the driver. BMWs are fun to drive, but so is a Porsche, Vette, Mini, Cobra, etc... What's pertinent to this group is how much sportiness can be dialed into a luxury sedan. I want a car that can be comfortable for clients. The Lexus certainly fits that bill. And though the lsdoes not have the presence and prestige of Mercedes, BMW falls a bit short in the prestige category as well. Almost all of the cars we discuss here are fine automobiles and we're all lucky to afford to drive them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Baddman, ??It's probably the same reason why you don't hear about the Jaguar XJ too often..Low volume compared to the LexusLS, S, and 7Series. My purchase of Lexus cars has nothing to do with name..I bought it when it's ""name"" was non existent back in the early nineties..A few reasons why I personally don't opt for Audi: Resale Value, Electronics quality doesn't match the LexusLS (I feel the Japanese have the edge here), and the ride isn't what I'm personally looking for. ?I'll admit I'm a huge Jaguar fan, but would never buy one for the reasons I stated for Audi...I simply don't have the time or patience to deal with a car that isn't trouble free..I love to push the example of the '92 lsthat I own..0 unexpected hours out of service..The only time I've been without it was for scheduled maintenance. Even then I was given a brand new LexusES as a loaner. ?My LexusLS certainly lacks the flair and driving dynamics of an Audi or Jaguar (Well at least the previous XJ) but that is compensated for with the outstanding quality, residual value, electronics, and customer service..I realize buying a high end car is never a fully rational decision, but in my book objectives have to come first..Just my two cents.. ?SV",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Be greatful that Lexus has only targeted America so far. That is about to change big-time in two years. By the end of the decade your touted brands will have lost some very serious marketshare points and will be hard pressed financially. Well heck, MB and VW have a boatload of financial problems already. One had to change the top CEO position because the former CEO lost his mind with the phaeton and was running the company into the ground and the other just changed the CEO position at the MB division level for a cost cutter for cryin out loud. I hope you understand what that means. ? Now - you are kidding me that you think the lshad a major redesign change in 2004. I hope so because the conversation is plain ludicrous. MB changed the grill and went to a 7 speed tranny and Lexus sharpened a few body panels and went to 6 speeds. The body styles went unchanged otherwise.

"Because of all the discussions on this board, I thought I give the SClass a fair shake and test drove the SClass today. The $5,600 AMG package makes the exterior look good enough to get inside the car (only if the color is black!). Once inside, the feel and quality of the metal switches and air vents and the shape of the steering wheel are very disappointing for a $90,000 car with no creature and convenience goodies (park sensors, back up camera, Luxo accommodations for the rear seat, key less entry and drive, power trunk, etc.) The command system is fun to use as long as you are not driving. The little plastic cover of the phone module was broken in my test car which shows you how clever the design is! But the leather was nice. I also liked the gear selector (I wish the new lshad it). Compared to the interior of the A8, the SClass feels more techi but the A8 feels more luxurious with better materials. The 7 feels techi with low grade materials (the wood is really bad) and scores third on the German list. To me functionality and feel of the interior is more important than the exterior looks. The power and over all feel of the SClass was better than my LexusLS but not so much that I go out of my way to buy the car. If the new LS460 substantially reduces the body roll of the current lsand provides better seats, there is no reason for me to buy a german Luxo Performance Car. The performance upgrade they provide over the lsdoes not compensate for their other short comings. Otherwise, there will be more test drives :P",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Been away for a while, well fear not I'm back. The Detroit Show was a true delight. I have never seen so much luxury and power on display. The stars of the show were the Cadillac Sixteen, Maybach 62 and Rolls-Royce Phantom. I missed my chance to sit in the Rolls by ""that much"" This is huge and elongated car. The interior is much nicer in person than it is in the pics on the net. The Rolls faithful will be pleased. The car my friends and I voted ""most needed to be built"" is the Cadillac Sixteen. Too bad I don't have a reliable digital camera, I got some great shots of the V16 engine. Cadillac would truly be worldclass if they built anything like the Sixteeen. The Maybach nearly generated a riot with people jumping up on the platform trying to get closer to it. The Maybach's magic is in it's interior, because truthfully the Cadillac Sixteen and Bentley Arnage look much better out the outside. Maybe the smaller 57 model will look better proportioned, it wasn't there. There was some surprises for me. I actually liked the Infiniti FX45 and the G35 Coupe. I'll definitely have to give the G35 Coupe a test drive when the time comes. Lexus isn't going to be able to meet demand for the RX , it looks a lot better than the RX300. BMW's 7Series continues to draw a lot of attention at the show and sales (2002 sales were much better than 2001). I don't really get it, but ok. Mercedes is putting 4Matic on every model that has more than 2 doors. The new SL600 was there and according to it's spec sheet it has a 6-speed automatic, I'm going to predict that this new 6-speed auto will become standard across the range, or at least for all S, CL, SClass andEClass cars for 2004. The Audi A8 didn't make the heart flutter like it should have. It almost to ""conservatively-handsome"" for it's own good. It does though have the best interior of the big three German luxury sedans. I just doesn't look as good as a SClass on the outside. I won't go into detail about how bad I want an RS6. Cadillac's XLR was like the Audi A8 somewhat of a disappiontment. It's too square and blocky, just doesn't have the look of a 75K car. Ferrari, Aston-Martin, and Lamborghini drew the usual ooohs and ahhhs. The Bentley Continental GT isn't a looker either, now that I've actually seen it. It's interior isn't up to the Arnage's standard either. I heard other people saying the same thing, so who knows.

They are without a doubt the worst website for automotive information. Do you ever notice how their ""inside"" is usually info already known to everyone, and/or it's already in print in a real publication like Autoweek. Autoweek can't be topped for prompt and accurate news delivery, autospies is garbage. Some examples:""The SL55 is being canceled for 2004"".....they even posted a made up lie about a customer that said: ""When I tried to place an order for a 2004 SL55 I was rejected and was told I could put a deposit down on a SL65, which per my salesman replaces the SL55 for 2004"". Not! The SL65 hasn't even been officially announced yet, better still Mercedes would never, ever cancel such a car in it's SECOND model year. Absurdish rubbish. The SClass is getting a cloth top for 2004. This is even more absurd than the above. I find it rather pathetic of them to post what C&D said and then agree with it, knowing they've never driven the car. You owe it to yourself to drive the A8 before writing it off. Car and Driver's test car appears to have been suffering from a software glitch concerning it's suspension. The rest of their article really didn't say anything bad about the car, they more or less weren't ""wowed"" by the car. They mainly harped about four things"" 0-60 times, styling, ride and it not being the lightest car in the class. That last point I somewhat understand because it's actually heavier than at least one of it's competitors ( SClass 4Matic), so that kinda makes one question why they should put up with buying an aluminum car if it isn't lighter than the rest, by a significant margin. The Jaguar XJ shows a clear weight advantage by using aluminum. However the A8's styling and ride are both very debatable, especially since their car was suffering from a glitch. It's 0-60 times are a little behind the SClass and 745i, but it's still within the class, so I don't see the big deal there either. I guess by now you realize I really like this car. Check out Edmund's review of it. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"believe it or not, you and I feel the same way about the ls-- or did, although not for all the same reasons. To me, the LexusLS was like a very large, sweet-natured woman who also happened to be a helluva cook -- a great wife, but nothing you'd fantasize about, if you get my drift.When I tested the LexusLS and IS300, though, I was actually more impressed with the lsthan I was the iS, simply because I expected less of it. The thing handled great, and the interior just made me drool. The styling is another story -- I still think it's ugly, especially the upright grille and goofy headlights. But if I wanted a large luxury car, it would definitely be on my short list.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Besides the XJ Type, I think it is the best. So second place in the ultra luxury class for me. It has great interior and especially exterior styling, a VERY powerful engine, LOTS of room, 95% of the features of it's competitors for 15% less, plus it DOESN'T have the features people don't want (iDrive, etc.). It is WAY better than 7Series,SClass, and LexusLS and equal to A8 and XJ Type.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BMW - Up but may not reach 300,000 sales. Lexus - Up substantially in 2006. New lsshould be a hit. Mercedes-Benz - Flat. Up or down slightly (~2%) for 2006. New C and E needed for the next big sales jump. Audi - Down for 2006. Not distinct enough to succeed against BMW and Mercedes. Infiniti - Flat or down slightly for 06. A super Q (a la LS) is needed to come to the rescue! G is aging. Jaguar - Another decline, not as steep in 2006. The XJ and XK lines aren't enough to put the brand up to 50,000+ units. Cadillac - Double digit car sales increase of recent years is tough to maintain. The DTS, CTS, STS and 'V' models combined with the new Escalade may make it happen again. Scott",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Boy, you guys can't get to sleep, can you? As my last post illustrated, or so I thought, you can be a ""winner"" many ways. You kind of sidestepped the question: Are Toyota Camry, Cadillac Escalade, Mitsubishi Eclipse, Ford Exploder, etc., ""losers""? If you sell big, but don't get critical acclaim, are you a ""loser""? XLR did neither, so I feel confident that the shoe fits. With regards to replacing Mercedes in the image pantheon (Lexus seems disinterested in competing with BMW), anyone who thinks they can do that in just 15 years is fooling themselves. I certainly never forcast that! And yes, until Lexus prices their cars as high as Mercedes, or Mercedes repositions themselves to compete with Lexus, and at that point, Lexus is still the preferred choice, Mercedes is still the King of the Hill. Where was Toyota Camry 20 years ago? Where is it today? I have every confidence that Lexus has a similar plan, and will reach whatever lofty goals they have set. But they are never in a hurry. It may take 30 years, but they'll climb that mountain! At the same point, just because Lexus offers a better value, like the Lexus LexusLS, doesn't mean it is a lesser car than aSClass, for example. This topic couldn't be more subjective or less tangible. Mercedes will not become Jaguar, at least not anytime soon. Lexus really can't do anything more than what they're doing. The only question is how far can they go? Same with Toyota. Asking Toyota/Lexus to, in essence, replace GM/Ford/Daimler-Chrysler, as they car/SUV/luxury marque of choice, is based upon potential. Toyota has that much potential. NO OTHER COMPANY DOES! In that regard, such a incredible expectation ,akes Toyota a victim of it's own success. Now if they don't replace Mercedes or if Tundra doesn't sell 300k units next year, if Camry doesn't go to 5000k units a year, or if Prius stops selling 100-125k units, then it's ""What's wrong with Toyota?"". Many luxury car shoppers, MANY, wouldn't consider a Mercedes, only a Lexus. At 300k sales a year, and still climbing 10% a year, I think it is time to start raising prices, if only to prevent diluting the brand through excessive volume. That's not easy, but it maybe time for Lexus to leave it's comfort zone, give up a couple of sales crowns, and reposition themselves directly against Mercedes, in some classes. DrFill",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Boy, you sure have an issue with the A8 don't you. The problem with the lsis that it is an old man's car in looks and in performance. If you choose to drive a car that puts you in total isolation from the road, that's your choice. Further, most enthusiasts do not even put the lexus lsin the same category as the A8, 7Series orSClass. I personally do not care if the lsoutsells all three of the above brands combined as it is not in the same league.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Brightness, yes it is true that Toyota just recently started using the Lexus nameplate it's native Japan. But the lshas always been there, right along side the Crown. While not called the LexusLS, the car was definetely a bold move on Toyota at the time, especially seeing how frugal their ""CEO's"" are there, really.And moreover, the A8 is not made anywhere else except Germany. No other manufacture has the support to build the precious aluminum body and quattro system. This is not to say that some parts are not domesticated from Asia, such as the optional Japanese Cherry wood interior..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but I honestly have no idea what the c-pillar is at all. Is it the pillar that seperates the front and rear door?...It seems to me that those who don't drive Jag's find them kind of bland, but I have a neighbor that drives a Vanden Plas model for over 10 years or so.in my opinion, the SClass looks really great with Designo Espresso with the AMG chrome 18 wheels. My neighbor has one, and I cannot stop looking atit. I am either surrounded by that SClass or new 2002 jet-black on black 745Li. When I used to have a LexusLS, they used to keep asking me ""Hey Will! STill driving that lex? Get a benz!"" Alas, I did, and have had problems from day one that still aren't fixed today...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But Lexus is quite profitable and has been for 10 years now. The only time they lost money was in the early 90's. The moment the lsstarted going into the 40's and on up to $60k the profits skyrocketed. The RX put them through the roof. They only have 250 dealers in the US so distribution costs are quite low, they have incredibly efficient production and low personnel costs because they used robots to build cars since day one. Toyota just knows what they are doing in this business better than anyone around. Even the Scion will be in the black sooner than anyone thinks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But more importantly, time is the enemy here ! People like Merc1 who doesn't own a luxury car or a truly sporty car can make statements which shows poor judgement and assessment of today's reality. Go on Merc1, I hope MB is NOT listening to you....The truth of the matter is that troubles often start small.... Little by little it creeps up on you, and before you know it, wham bam.... you are standing in the middle of an empty building, and wondering what happened. Granted it is not doomsday for the Euro cars, BUT, it will be foolhardy to ignore the obvious trends. Barely 5 years ago, MB was the undisputed sales leader in lux car sales in the US. Today, it is Japan's Lexus brand. Why ? MB is not just out of first place, it is dangerously close to becoming 4th behind Cadillac. What trend is this ? BMW releases much anticipated new redos of its flagship 7Series. Tank job ! They make unprecendent move to redo a redo within 2 years of release. Not much change in its fortunes. Spell trouble to BMW ? Not to Merc1's thinking. And then came the new 5Series. Tank job x2. Buyers were scrambling for the 2003 5Series rather than the new 2004 design. For the savvy buyers (like designman), buying the '03 before the '04 came out turned out to be a great move. Today, you see BMW's sales declining and someone is suggesting it's no big deal. How many upper-class auto companies come out with redos only to lose sales ??? Typical trend is the opposite. Recall how much the 4th-gen 2001 lssales was compared to the 2000 year ? It flat out was a huge sale success.... Even the slight tinker in the 2004 has been an unquestionable sale success. Germany will need to learn a lot from Japan, especially the recent successes of Infiniti and Acura, with Lexus threatening to run away with the lux car division if unchalleneged.As we march into the future, Japan's Lexus will once again prove to Germany that if you can't accuratel predict future car trends, there is no other direction to go but down. Watch Lexus' lead in hybrid technology, and incorporation into all of their top end cars within the next 3 years. MB and to a lesser extent BMW still doesn't get it. They are planning for diesel ! Yeah, right. Guess we'll see whose plan works out best.Time will certainly tell..... and time is a real enemy for inertia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"bwia - the target you mention is not unrealistic when you put it like this. Then again, 1,500 cars at over $300k is a hell of a lot, historical market trends for ultra-luxury cars in hand. If 50% are to be sold in the USA (which is a perfectly valid assumption), it means they have to sell 2 every day. That is a lot of $300k cars, and can't happen without stealing away very sizeable market share from someone else, Ferrari included. Historically, volumes for such cars have not been as high. We will have to see whether the combined lot of Bentleys, Rolls, Maybach etc etc really deliver on their projections. It will be interesting to observe, especially considering that sales for luxury cars in general (anything over $40k) are down. The super-rich are never as dependent on macro-economic trends, of course, but all you need is for understatement to become chic to really create some hurt in that market. I think there the equation becomes whether something is unique and cool enough to get them to spend yet *another* $300k on yet another car, and while the Maybach might fit the bill, if I had that type of money the Maybach would be one of the last cars to truly get my jiuces flowing. Unless the company forces it upon me as a corporate limo, I probably would not consider it. I'd much rather have something with personality, like a Bentley Arnage. Incidentally, Georg Kacher arrived at exactly the same conclusion after driving the Bentley, Maybach and Rolls offerings, and while everybody's taste is likely to be different, he usually gets the car enthusiast's choice very right.As to the Maserati, the design all in all is sound, with some Maserati cues (which historically have not been the prettiest Italian cars, I think), but somewhat droopy looking in the front. I think the lower part, scoops and such, of the car front let the design down, they seem kit-car-like add-ons, even though lights and grill and hood are quite nice.The Phaeton has received terrible reviews in the German press. It's supposed to drive very ponderously and feel heavier than it is. The quality of the cabin is supposed to be awesome, however. It seems getting the first luxury sedan out of the door is always going to be an experiment at first - Audi in its time also took its time getting the feel of the A8 right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The S80, Seville, and 9-5 sold GREAT! Especially the 9-5, which has been out a while and is known about by few people!!! The A8 and S8 should be combined and the 9-5, Seville, S80, M45, GS300/430, and S Type shouldn't be there as they are in the mid-level luxury class.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bz4: in my mind the presence of front wheel drive on the Acura is an argument FOR and not against it compared to the Lexus. As I want AWD in my winter car the Lexus is out (even if liked everything else about it--which I don't). The Acura is at least a reasonable second choice by virtue of its FWD, aesthetics and overall value for the money. If I couldn't afford an MB I would definately go with Acura rather than Lexus. When we are talking about cars costing over 60 K value isn't really in the equation at all. Nobody buys an LexusLS or SClass because of ""value"". They are just not ""worth"" it on an incremental cost basis. If you can comfortably afford these cars then cost should be considered essentially to be a 'burnt offering.'i_drive: I'm in the market for an '04SClass. Unfortunately there are plenty of unsold '03s laying around in dealer inventories (here in the midwest) including AWD models. Dealers are anxious to move these out before the '04s come out at the end of October so I'm certain you can get a great deal on them in the next few weeks. I saw an SClass with MSRP of 78 K on which you could probably have picked up at least a 5 K discount. That's a pretty good deal on this incredible car. Go for it. Unfortunately for me this probably means no deals off list price for the '04s. Maybe I'll go for one of the leftover 03s myself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Call me crazy, but I just don't see how a person can find an Aston-Martin to be a knockout design and like the ls's homely front end at the same time. The two are just as opposite as opposite can be. The 5Series has grown on me quite a bit, especially with the sport package and in certain colors, looks downright good to me. Still don't like the interior as much though. footie - you do realize that Kia's newest car is THE biggest styling knockoff on the market today. There is a huge collection of Mercedes and Jaguar cues in that ugly thing. Audi's grille design was in place on their cars before there ever was a Kia. This is one of the points I try to stress on this board - tradition. Audi is only going back to it, while Kia is groping. oac - all I can say at this point is that we're past that and you probably need to give it a rest.

The 911 C4S in tiptronic from! No I don't think you're anti-German, but I'm the same way when it comes to German cars compared to Lexus because most (not all) of the Lexi's that rag on German cars here have never even driven or owned a Mercedes, BMW or Audi, yet claim that they're such piss-poor cars, and all of their harping is based on three things, JDP, CR and the WSJ. I couldn't believe it when a LexusLS owner came up with so many excuses and so much pure bs to defend what truly was a awful car, a certain Cadillac that was debated a few weeks back. This is the knowledge base I'm supposed to rely on to tell me which car is ""best"". I don't think so. Please don't lump me in with posters like audibob. You think Lexuses are great, obviously others don't think so, it is all personal preference beyonds the surveyed factuals. You tend to talk about stereos, navs and reliability and fans of other brands simply don't place those things as high as styling or driving pleasure, and they tend to define the latter differently. Nav systems and great stereos don't define luxury for everyone, nor is that all to it. What gets me about some Lexus folk is that they seem to think that their criteria for a luxury car is the bible and written in stone and that every car should be as detached from the driving experience like a LexusLS or ES330, which are Lexuses biggest sellers are brand-identity cars. The IS300 might put down the numbers of a 3Series, but the car has been complete commercial flop. Why? Because Lexus buyers simply don't care about a BMW-like car. Something I tried to articulate at the start of this BMW vs. Lexus outbreak. Ditto for the GS. Not even your friend with all the sales rhetoric can deny this. Porsche can help Lexus with the GS, but Lexus' values of smoothness and silence aren't going to be thrown away in the name of handling, so I hardly expect the new GS to do anything to the 5Series on the track or in the showroom. Furthermore the IS300 is an totally icomplete car compared to the 3Series. It is too small and has what I'll be nice and call a very un-Lexus-like interior. I've always said Lexuses were ""quality"" and if you don't care about a how a car looks or drives, then by all means. If you want something that doesn't put you to sleep, look elsewhere.

"Can you imagine a world like this board where everyone criticized the guy who follows suit. There would never be improvement and there would never be any change at the top. There'd be stagnation as there was in the luxury segment until Lexus came along and caused everyone to scramble. The hardcore German enthusiasts have a real hard time with that last sentence. But the real buyers are so glad there is so much choice now. merc1 - you read so much into the power issues. The comments always were that with cars that go 0-60 in 6 seconds on 290-320HP and with great torque - why is there a ""real"" need for anything more. We are talking main stream cars here not exotic specialty cars. We also were saying pour the investment money into things that produce a better and safer car rather than even more excess power. Need should have a higher priority than excess. In the big cities wherte 90% of these cars are sold you can't use that power very often anyway. What percent of MB's or BMW's sold do you think have 400-600HP. Maybe 5% and that is a real stretch. So to portray that power as brand representation is one heck of a statistical flaw. Lexus reliability - Now it's amazing to me to hear that the majority of Lexus buyers are people who can't wait for a survey to come in the mail and answer them. Merc1, my friend that's a comment that I'd wish I could take back if I were you. The Lexus stellar reliability level is what it is - the envy of the industry. Just accept it and move on rather than trying to defeat it with silly comments that make you look bad. Today if I were an MB buyer I would fully expect reliability to be a problem no matter what car I bought. On the other hand I'd be a lot harder on Lexus than I would be on MB because I'd be expecting perfection or near perfection. I expected it in 1995 and got it with my first ls(which had over 250k miles on it when I last checked with my buddy who bought the car at lease end). I expected it in 1998 with 2 vehicles and got it, in 2001 with 3 and got it and I expect it now and have gotten it so far. Most - as in 90+% of Lexus buyers expect the same and thus will naturallly be more prone. not less, to report anything wrong.

"Check the stats for European sales before you say that the lsis more prevalent than the A8L. Also, the a8 beat the Lexus in a comparo from Motor Trend last year. It all depends on the magazine. The a8 has garnished more world-wide accolades than any car in its class. A3s aren't sold in the US first of all. Audi moved 12100 A8s in Western Europe, BMW moved 12150 7Series, and MB moved about 16,000SClasses in Western Europe in 2004. Lexus sold a total of 20,000 vehicles in Western Europe, so I do not see how there are more LSs in Europe than A8s as you claim. You get a reality check and don't belittle other people because they do not agree with your opinion, because that is all it is. A true end high luxury marquee as you state would only apply to Rolls, Bently, etc. if you use your logic. Again, you fail to see my point. A true luxury marquee must have a world presence. Why is Lexus now turning to design and performance aspects because it sees it cannot shove mindless cars down European's throats as it does in America. World-wide, Lexus is a poser and that is it. Come back in ten years and then start your discussion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Circling the wagon (a la Chris Berman, ESPN), so to speak. I have been gone from reading this thread for months. Came back to find over 200 posts in a spate of 2 months. Couldn't bare to read through ALL, but the *few* I read shows we haven't moved much. The old Merc_vs_LS argument still persists. Granted it is entertaining, but for how long ?I mentioned this quite a while ago on the lsboard that a friend of mine, a die-hard MB fan for over 20 years, is finally making the move from his SClass to the 2004 LexusLS. He waited out the 2003 model bcos he found out about the changes to the 2004, especially the 18"" wheels and the much improved sport-tuned (Euro) model. Well, he is now waiting for his to arrive at the dealership. He got exactly what he wanted, and for a whole lot less than the MB sales guy quoted him for a comparable SClass. Along with the SClass he currently owned, he also had a 760iL which he literary gave away to charity a couple years back. One more lsowner, and one LESS MB owner. Personally, I cannot wait to take it for a spin. Would be fun comparing the 2004 LexusLS Euro to my *decrepit* 1999 LexusLS with the oh so soft suspension....Me, I wait for the 2007 re-do. Will do whatever it takes to buy one in 3 years from now, trading in my current 1999 model. Which, btw, continues its spotless work with narry a problem to report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Come now, does anyone really believe that whatever price difference there is between the A8 and LexusLS, that that price difference accounts for the lsselling 5.4 TIMES as many units (U.S., cy2004)? ? If price elasticity were that high, all Audi would have to do is lower its prices to lslevels, and volumes would explode...Audi would mint money based on the incremental profits of each car. ? Put another way, if Audi lowered its prices to lslevels, does anyone think that it would sell the same number of units as the LS? Come on!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Come on now the Crossfire looks like a CLK, but the new 04's LexusLS doesn't take any styling cues from the current SClass in it's facelift? Its a little bit hard to believe you really think something like that. One view is obvious and the other isn't even close. The ls's tailights for example, why a clear lense treatment like theSClass? It's ridiculous and was done for no other reason than to look like the Mercedes. Chrysler and Mercedes ""mixing"" isn't going to cause MB to loose any buyers. In case you haven't noticed, Chrysler is using the old platforms from Mercedes, and the Pacifica isn't built on a Mercedes chassis. Chrysler is having the same problems they've always had, slow sales due to a bad reputation for quality in the recent past, and in the case of the Pacifica, it's pretty expensive for a Mopar product. So far they haven't done anything that a Mercedes buyer will care about. But you're right if they did the unthinkable and shared C, E and SClass hardware with a Chrysler there will definitely be a problem. As for the ""passion"" viewpoint...we should probably agree to disagree there too because you're still talking about a silky smooth ride as being something passionate. What you're talking about is your priorities (can't argue with those) when buying a car, not passion. If the lstruly had any of this (""passion"") you'd be talking about how it drives and feels compared to how it rides. I guess I can understand how you'd be passionate about a car, especially an expensive one like the LexusLS, but I can't see why. Why is it that a magazine only cares about a racetrack one minute (i.e. when they put a Lexus down), but in other instances when they don't like an A8 (C&D) they're oh so right about everything. Now I see you and DonnFenn feel that Maxhonda nor I aren't allowed to discuss this because we don't own own a Benz or Lexus. When all else fails thats whats ususally said. I don't need to own a Lexus to know what kind of cars they are, or whether or not they appeal to me or any other person that calls themselves an enthusiast. I really don't need to own one to have an opinion on their styling either. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Come to think of it, it is darn interesting that Lexus, despite a tuning division, has come up with very innovative and state-of-the-art engines lately. To review, let us look back at what was, and today, what is...1990 LexusLS --> 4.0L V8, 250hp: this engine ran for 10 years (1990 - 2000), and only a marginal tweak to 278hp for the Gen-2 ls(1998 - 2000).2001 - 2006 --> 4.3L V8, 278hp: this engine was re-bored to get an additional .3L displacement, but no real dynamic change in output.2007 LS460 --> 4.6L V8 380hp: wow !!! Lexus goes from 4.3L to 4.6L and increases output >100hp !!! To wring out 380hp from that little displacement is outstanding, especially considering it takes almost 1L extra displacement for MB to come up with the same 380hp in the new SClass. Props to Lexus and their engineers for this marvel of enigneering....Now imagine if Lexus had a tuner division, what could they do to these fine engines in the IS (3.5L 306hp) and ls(4.6L 380hp) ! In the IS350, the displacement/hp ratio of ~90 is only matched or exceeded by Porsche. In the LS460, it blows away the 7Series and SClass's motor performance which requires a 5.0L or higher displacement to compete with Lexus' 4.6L motor. The new 5.0L V8 in the LS600h must have close to 450hp (~90*5L ~ 450), although Lexus will detune it for luxury and performance with the hybrid. That's why it is difficult to imagine a 430hp in the LS600h which includes two batteries! I daresay, this engine will see a lotta work in future upgrades of the LexusLS, and we can expect within a few years to see an LSClass, with outputs exceeding 400hp, with a concomittant upgrade of the LS600h to >500hp. Yum !",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Compare a 120K SClass to a $70K LexusLS then blast it for copying. Let's not forget all that Toyota/Lexus has given to the luxury car game in the last 10 years. They have added innovations in many areas. True, the styling, especially, on the current LexusLS is a rip-off. But very little does Lexus copy from other car brands. Features are copied all the time. That is a stupid thing to even bring up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Call me lazy but I'm not going to go through 2000+ posts. I'll gladly read specific ones if you can direct me to them (#2228 is a wrong number...doesn't refer to a merc1 post on either this board or the LexusES board).If the lsis ""pure 1992-1999SClass"", have you ever mistaken one for the other, or do you know anyone who has? Personally, I think there is as much resemblence between the two as there is between a 2000-2003 S and a Ford Taurus. In other words, not much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dare I say you and other Lexus fans are making way too much out of absolutely nothing. Motor Trend gains what again by trying to intentionally misrepresent the facts on the LS460? Does that make any sense? If you look at page 107 in the March issue of Motor Trend it clearly shows a picture of the LF-SH Concept, not the production LS460. This likely means that as the March issue went to press (likely early Jan/late Dec), they for one didn't have the offical specs and they certainly didn't have the pics of the production car. The writeup clearly states ""with an expected 350hp and seven speed automatic"", meaning they were speculating. You'll notice none of the monthly automags have any Detroit pictures from the actual show, just writeups based on info given right before the show. In the April issue of MT you'll see pics and info right from the show floor in Detroit. Are they still biased at the end of article when they state: ""Is it possible to get even more perfect""? The Maybach 57S has been out in Europe since late last year and all the mags have driven it already at its press introduction, unlike the LS460. The Maybach 57S isn't a new car like the LS460, it really is just and engine/interior update of an existing car, meaning there really isn't much to ""know"". I can't believe you actually think MT would try to deliberately downplay any particular car when the truth of the matter is their information was speculation as the March issue likely went to press before the official info came out. All this about they've shown their ""bias"" is really ridiculous IMO. Magazines speculate all the time until they get the offical info to press. You know full well they will have the correct specs next month after having been given/seen the correct info at Detroit. I can see it now, you'll use this printing/timing issue (which is really a non-issues) as the basis of a ""they're biased"" excuse if the LS460 doesn't ace the inevitable comparo MT will have once they can get the LS460/750/SClass/A8 together. Just for the record their website (you know the media that can be updated with no delay) has the correct information. Their website has had this information posted since the car was introduced at the show, clearly before the magazine went to press. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Denali- your arguments are going under faster than the titanic. Look at maxhonda's response to your comment-Denali- ""so stripped downEClasses are used as taxi cabs. that is nothing new. please explain to me how this diminishes MB's luxury brand appeal? "" Maxhonda- How does the LexusLS being a Celsior diminish the ls's luxury appeal?? AT least the LexusLS or Celsior both come decked out with Leather, alloy wheels, power seats, etc. Denali never responds to these queries and can't really see through the smoke and mirrors that is marketing, ""image"", and prestige. You put down the lsas a rebadged Celsior, but shouldn't you say that a juiced-up american version of EClass isn't just a ""rebadged"" european taxicab? And if you say more taxicabs are good for MB, then how can you diminish the value of Lexus's best seller, the RX300/ RX ? And you're the type of person who would be the first to criticize Lexus if they produced an inexpensive $20K car, and then praise MB for making the A class and Smart cars. Can you really not see the contradictions in your own arguments?You still didn't answer my other question earlier- would your A8 be diminished somehow as a luxury sports sedan if it said VW on the hood instead of Audi? To me, there's not that much difference between Audi and Lexus. Their cars are generally based, in construction/engines/suspensions/etc, on VW's and Toyotas. The A8 deviates the most from this due to it's aluminum construction. But consider the electronics, transmission, suspension, engines, I believe it is still based in large part on the Phaeton. In any case, imho, aluminum or not, the A8 is still a beautiful, but heavy car with a brittle ride, mediocre steering, and questionable reliability, that costs about $15K more than the L430. I respect that you purchased the A8- it's a fine car- but don't start justifying it to yourself and everyone else by criticizing the LexusLS, because for every argument you make praising Audi and MB, there's several more that make Lexus look like a far more rational and intelligent, if not as emotional buy-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Denali, It's the fact that Lexus has been so successful in the biggest market of them all: the USA...It's like saying the best team in the NFL couldn't do battle in the Canadian Football league. Without a doubt you're correct in saying they'll have to modify the design and feel of their cars. What luxury true flagships are you talking about? Most cars I see in London are S320's,Jag Xj6's and 735i's..I haven't seen a Single Audi A8 yet, but have been quite a few ls's. You can't disqualify Lexus on the basis of Wheelbase!!! As earlier posts point out, neither is AWD a criteria for judging a marque..It seems your judgements about Europe aren't true..I'm here right now and have yet to confirm anything you've said...Prestige doesn't come with marketing a SClass or 750 that hardly anyone buys!!! If that were the case Jaguar never would have retired the XJ12. Even their Supercharged Vanden Plas XJ doesn't sell that well,in fact their best seller is the XJ6!!..Prestige in my book is selling eye catching, high performance, superior quality cars. I don't know what you're harping on about, but nothing the Germans offer is especially breath taking in design..They've managed to even screw up Rolls Royce..The new one is hardly as stately as the old one..My British colleagues feel the same way about the Jaguar XJ as well. If I wanted a breath taking car I'd buy an older XJ. Nothing the Germans make can match the inviting Gentleman's Club interior that the Vanden Plas has. Sure they offer more electronics, but Jaguar has them beat in styling and even quality to boot! (look at the last JDP survey) What do you think of that! As I mentioned a few posts before I was looking to justify a purchase of a XJ without having my wife steal it or kick me out..Well I found the perfect excuse! My son will be returning home from college here in London and will be in the market for a car..Unfortunately, I've taught him too well and he wants to lease himself an ES330...In an attempt to bribe him I've offered to subsidize a purchase of a '03 XJ..This way I get to have my cake and eat it too!!SV",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Denali:You are stretching and clawing at straws now. Seems you cannot see that a luxury brand seller of the *prestige* and status and cache (throw in as many adjectives as you'd like here) of MB has their goods being used as sherpas, diminishes the brand status. That's cool tho'.... For me, Lexus is a brand I like. They make cars and trucks that fit my lifestyle, at this particular time of my life. Maybe when I turn 50 or something, I may change my lifestyle and go with a Bentley or a Kia.... Who knows ??? Enjoy your A8, it is a testament to your hardwork and success. The A8 is a very fine automobile with a task that may be slightly different from the LexusLS. But both are extremely good and capable cars.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the first I'm back on Edmunds, since they shut down a board where Nissan & Honda owners were really trying to run each other over.Don, congrats on your XJR. I've seen quite a few new XJ, none of the new A8. Audi probably will still have problems selling its excellent sedan.What do you think of new 6 series? I think it's the Z4 frontend grafted to 7Series backend. Hideous! And believe or not, I'm partial to BMW.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Denaliinpa - when was the last time you were in Europe?? Lexus has a tiny distribution chain in Europe because they haven't built any cars for the market. Their effort is virtually all through their Toyota dealers which just established a broader distribution chain in the last couple of years. You'd have to drug Toyota to get them to set up distribution in Europe the way they have set up the Lexus chain in the US when their is no preconceived strategy like they had for the US in 1989. Europe has been nothing but a jab so far for them but that changes in about 2 years. The scary thing I'd be concerned about if I were a European lux make, fan or one who can't handle Lexus success is that they have taken more serious steps in the UK and sales leaped immediately. You will see plenty of SC430's and ls's in England. Now Europe is a very nationalistic society. They want their goods built there. They don't care if the company is not European but they want the goods built in Europe. Importing is a last alternative to that society. But if the EU doesn't open it up for Lexus wait to you see how quickly Japan shuts it down for the Europeans. This part isn't about car tastes, it's about regulations that can be changed by municipalities.As I said, I'd look at the fact that Lexus sold 20K cars with virtually no effort and the fact that they are quickly penetrating England with a lot of fear if I were a German lux make. What happened in the US is inevitable in Europe. Selling nearly 300K cars in the US thru 240 dealershios is a real scary efficiency that I'd worry about too. A great product at a lower price point that equals or surpasses the home grown product cannot be denied. That is business 101.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Designman - why would you think that. What you show on the top pix is more of what a rear occupant might see and a small one at that. I sit with a view well above the steering wheel and I'd expect the bottom picture is more what the driver, front passenger and tall rear occupants would see. In fact I have driven the RX often and that is the way you see it. Nevertheless the lsis balancing fingertip switches for a lot of features with luxury interior appointments and I think it is done quite well. Plus - if this is the tradeoff for I-drive - I'll take it with no questions asked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Designman, here is the link to the Autoweek article on the LF-Sh: http://www.autoweek.com/article.cms?articleId=103477In my opinion, the article is right to say the LF-Sh is 85% of what the new lswill be. Lexus has a history of showing production cars in advance as ""concept"" cars. They did it with the 1st-gen RX, they did it with the 2nd-gen GS, they did it with the 2nd-gen SC, etc. All were labeled as concept cars yet all turned out to be the real deal except for some minor trim like the grille. Lexus does indeed sometimes bring concepts to fruition.It is easy to distinguish a concept car like the LF-A from a production-ready concept car like the LF-Sh. The production-ready concepts look like real cars and have things like rearview mirrors, door handles, etc.Also, the LF-Sh is not simply a shell as you say it may be. The article clearly states the LF-Sh is fitted with a V8 hybrid system and all-wheel drive. I'm sure the car has a full interior, Lexus is just not yet showing it. Besides, the LF-Sh just looks like a production-ready car.I am certainly convinced the LF-Sh is the next LexusLS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Designman: ? That 90+% number was a conjecture on my part interpolating from the 90% number you provided for Porsche owners (for a group of owners that truly should be performance-driven), when compared to BMW that builds X order of magnitude more cars than Porsche. ? But I do not want to be mistaken for a BMW basher ! Prior to buying my LexusLS, I was looking for a *sporty* car hence my test drive of the follwoing cars - GS300, IS300, A6 3.0, and 528i. My wife voted for the BMW, and I was this close to pulling the trigger on it, until I got behind the wheels of an LexusLS. I realised how much a luxurious car truly is. The lsis a car than wins you over once you test drive it. WRT BMW, My criticisms are NOT directed at you owners, but at BMW corporate. I am sure they (or their surrogates) are reading these boards. My personal feeling is that they are on a turn for the worse - design and reliability-wise, at the most in-opportune time. With greater cut-throat competition from Infiniti and Acura, and Lexus promising to mount a real (and formidable) challenge starting in MY2006. We'll see how all this shakes out ....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Did you drive the A8 and if so what did you think of it? I think the A8's problem is it falls short of a BMW in sport and far short of an S or lsin ride quality. The sport end of this segment will always be in the minority as luxury, a great ride and reliability is what most people want. Thus the dominance of the lsand S in the segment.As someone pointed out the long-lived MB engines were diesels, not gas. That connection is missed by many people and plays into MB's myth and to a certain extent, its prestige. But the fact that resale values have fallen so far and so fast (night and day from 2001 when I last cross-shopped) is an indicator that the falloff in prestige is not far off and is already happeming. One is the bolt of lightning and the other is the thunderclap. They are tied to each other. Can they remedy it? Don't think so. They'd have to build bullet-proof cars immediately. On top of that the hybrids will revolutionize this segment and they won't be leading it. Both they and BMW got so caught up in electronic gadgetry that they seem to have missed the obvious direction the market is evolving to. That being hybrids, great nav systems, great creature comforts, fabulous service, easy user friendly electronics and world-class stereos.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, you have to compare diesel with a diesel-hybrid not Gas-hybrid.ETHANOL: It seems like a huge non-starter. brazil has extensively destroyed its ecological balance by switching to ethanol and large scale sugar-cane farming. Idiots! I just saw a documentary on PBS on how brazil destroyed amazon, (there was other stuff on Africa as well but not relevant here)Our market is 17 MILLION VEHICLES and brazil is 1 million only. THINK ABOUT IT! how much corn we will need. Outrageous level of farming will be needed which will dramatically destroy the quality of soil and damage the environment forever.

They have topped the JD Power quality surveys for a long time now. Their very reputation is built on quality materials, solid build quality and advanced technology. Something between $30-$40K could be a loaded IS350 or ES330, depending on whether you want sport or quiet luxury.

"Comparison (euphemism for fans bashing each other over the head :-) would be a lot easier if the carmakers were making identical products or at least products targetting exactly the same audience . . . except in reality they do not. E, 5 and GS are rough equivalents from the respective mfrs but no exact match-ups. E350 vs. 530i vs. GS300, and E550 vs. 550i vs. GS430/450h are roughly match-ups . . . there is nothing from MB or lexus that is even a close matchup for 525i, which accounts for close to 40% of 5Series sales.Also, there is no GS wagon like the 5 or E wagons, so a Lexus buyer of mid-size wagons would have to go for RX, which dwarfs the sales any other model from any of the three HELM marques. Buyers of E,5 and GS are essentially looking for a mid-sized family car, for the well-heeled. For someone stepping into the Lexus dealership, GS, especially the GS300, is way overshadowed by the ES350 and RX350 from a value perspective . . . performance buyer would pick IS350 or wait for the GS450H. Before you laugh, the subsidized lease cost for 525i at $500/mo is really closer to that of the LexusES and RX, at $450/mo and $500/mo respectively, than to the GS and E at $600/mo or higher (well, when E is heavily not subsidized depending on the calendar of the year).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Doc, we'll just have to agree to disagree on your path of destruction towards the Audi brand, and others. It doesn't matter which bracket you or merc puts the brand in, I own one and I know that it is a very commendable car, and yes a true HELM(so of the ""legit"" HELM's shouldn't even be considered onw). Perception? I could give a hoot what someone driving the everyday LexusLS or SClass/550 thinks of my very rare W-12.BTW: Going back a few pages, wasn't it some of you guys that said the BMW should kill of the 7Series as it isn't considered a HELM here in the US and that it is ""destroying"" the brand? Very interesting, how quickly we forget...Sales? No the US sales are not the best(at least for the A8( but with a very short lot life) as the refreshened A4's are increasingly hard to get with only a 8 day lot life, 14 for the A6, which is above average for luxury makes), and I know you have blinders on as to what happens off of our shores, but let me inform you that often times, the A8 is the best selling car in all of Europe, and with the car having an onslaught of taking many of the other ""established"" cars territory in developing countries in the Middle East(think UAE, Dubai, others), they are more than just a hiccup on the luxury screen.BTW: Where are you getting this 100 day supply from? Most parts of the country, you can't even obtain an A8 because there sold out and Audi ships to the US in limited quantities, something that will change in '09. I waited for 3 months to get mine(7 months now with the S8), and I'm so glad I did as this is the best car that I've ever ordered. And as Reality so eloquently pointed out, the Audi brand has much history like MB. So the heritage is there.So for the tiers. Sure in the US, the Audi tends to rank behind the other makes, which if just wholly based on sales data, then the whole chart thing is oblivious and right out unnecessary. And putting Audi in a bracket with a maker that only makes V6(minivan and/or car platforms) FWD cars shows just how rigged and corrupted this whole debate is. And for the whole perception thing, for Cadillac, which is enjoying some of the best sales in recent months, has some of the best quality studies as of late(not thinking of 10-20 years ago), and who's ressurection is truly remarkable, I don't think that people should write them off so easily.But here's the knocker: Why would a top tier tap into a lower tier to help them(a performance company needing help from a lowly, ""semi"", unremarkable, no-mans luxury company) on tranny's? They should have all of what it takes to build the perfect tranny seeing how they're the most profitable in the world. This definetely proves everything at the surface is surely not what is at the bottom....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Doc, you are right on the mark again. It seems like the problem confronting Tagman, syswei, hpowders and especially LJ is a generation gap crises.

These are old-school guys from the early boomer gen. or even earlier.They are able to understand what we are telling them but their experience and memories are revolting in their minds. In other words they are suffering from the 1992 mentality. Its 2006 now and its time for ls460 to compete with SClass with prices matching A8/7 +/- $1-2K.

"AWD is a requirement for me too, and that's why I don't have an lsyet, I have a LX and RX for my family.Apparently Toyota has had AWD on the Celsior (LS's name in Japan) for years, but for some reason hasn't brought it to the US yet. Stupid, imho.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Doc you're confused. I know you didn't bring up the $50k CLK as a C320 coupe! YOU can't wait to announce it as a SC430 competitor, and superior at that. The CLK and C-Class sedan share a platform, and that's about it. Yeah I did as to say that the CLK's sales aren't counted in the C-Class like BMW counts their 3Series coupes in with their sedan. The CLK shares its engines and platform with the C-Class sedans, just like the 3Series coupes and sedans do, but the difference is the CLK is priced like anEClass. Point being that the C doesn't have the variants like the 3Series when it comes time to count the sales numbers. Yes the CLK500 soon to be CLK550 will trounce your SC430 as did the CLK430 before it. The SC430 is as lame of a duck as you claim the C-Class is. The CTS, TL, 3Series, G35, and LexusES all DOUBLE C-Class sedan sales! Are you sure about this? Don't have time to look up the numbers at the moment, but again the C-Class is the oldest car of the lot so like I said before it is very easy to pick on its sales at this point. Shall we talk about the free fall the LexusLS is doing this year? Of course not because common sense tells us that it is going to drop like a rock with all the newer competition on the market so you harping about the C's sales smacks of desperation to the highest power. Its quite rediculous actually. More on your tall sales claims in a few! Picking on the looks of the LexusES smacks of desperation, Merc. You'd be doing a jig if the C-Class could sell anything like the LexusES, which has dominated the C-Class for, I don't know, 15 years? Once again, you fail to understand what competes with what. The C-Class is a smaller, rwd sedan that doesn't compete with the push box, pokeman mobile one on one. Yeah I said the new LexusES is ugly, it is as ugly as all getout. Domination you say? Likewise, that is what the E has done to the GS all these years. Talking about the C's sales this late in its life smacks of desperation because the only thing happening to the C's sales is what happens to all cars in their 6th model year! The C-Class is like that little, nasty, leftover runt piece, at the end of the string of sausage. Only the truly desperate and depraved grab that piece.Kinda how I felt about the previous IS,GS and every lsfrom 1995-2006. Regarding the LexusES vs GS, Lexus doesn't position the GS as a step up from the LexusES, as the interior room is about the same, and their missions are clearly different. As I've stated before, the lsis the Es' big brother, and the GS, is SUPPOSED TO BE the IS' big brother. That Lexus hasn't followed up on that promise is one of their few mistakes of late. Well is that some dodo marketing on their part. How could a car that is priced more than another from the same brand NOT be a step up? That is just plain dumb on Lexus' part. Then again this goes back to what I said about Lexus' and their wannabe sport image, they don't have one because on paper and in reality (if I go by your comments about the GS' lack of space compared to the ES) the LexusES makes more sense to most buyers, making the GS like totally irrelevant. The GS ain't no BMW and if it isn't roomier than the LexusES then what is the point of buying one. Now watch as the GS' numbers sink even further while the new LexusES takes off. I'm pretty sure you've never heard me applaude their dynamics, except at times like when C&D called the last GS430 a virtual equal to the 540i in dynamics in 2000 in a comparison. Or when MT said the GS was BETTER in '98. The last GS was what the current M is now. The overachiever. But they left well enough alone, and that won't cut it anymore. Another Lexusfan backs away from their middleweight darling, the GS. All that jazz about 1998 and 2000 is eons ago, get with the program doc as in at least 2005 or better! You since the GS's current design hit the road. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Don, Thanks for keeping us posted on the Jaguar. I am hoping to drive the a8 this weekend.I was looking at the Mercedes message boards here, and was shocked to see all of the owners' complaints. SClass (command system) andEClass electrical bugs. I have had a deposit on an SClass for one year, but I think that I am going ask for its return. I am #92 on the list. I really enjoyed my 2002 LexusLS Ultra, and may end up getting another one if I like the 2004. The Lexus may not be the most exciting car to drive, but I think that its reliability and luxury make it a rewarding ownership experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Don't confuse the Lexus ES300 with the Lexus LexusLS. The performance of the LexusLS with 295HP (2005) and six speed transmission is far from being a laggard. All Lexus models are thot to be luxury cars; however, the LexusLS is a car in it's own class and should not be compared to the other Lexus cars.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't include me on your list. Once you have a V8 that's what you want. Don't know where you get your data from but everyone I know wants a V8 in a premium lux sedan. It's one of the reasons I stopped buying Acuras. You could feel the difference between a Legend and an LexusLS within seconds of stepping on the gas. On top of that there isn't much difference between the MPG I get in an LexusLS and what a 6cyl ES330 gets. If gas price goes up another 40% (Europe gas itself is actually cheaper than here because of the weak dollar - worldwide oil is priced in the US dollar not in local currency - it's taxes that are the problem there) what's the big deal to a lux car buyer. He'll pay an extra $600 more annually on a car that sells for $60K+ and leases for a nearly a grand or more a month. It's simply not an issue and unless there is an illegal coalition by the auto mfrs or a worldwide government action there will always be plenty of demand for V8's. When the hybrids arrive your gas mileage argument really becomes a thing of the past and power will be all the more the rage. Lexus is already planning a real powerful V8 hybrid in 2006/7 that will rival current V12's and get 50 mpg.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Don't like the styling on the new SClass or LexusLS. Scared to buy another BMW because of the numerous problems I had with my 7Series l. My Jaguar Vanden Plas needs to be redesigned because its becoming a little dated. I'm also afraid that Ford is going to cheapen the Big Cat. A8 needs some exciting styling to get me to pay 60-70k for an Audi. Not much interested in the RL, Q45, or Cadillac. Whats a luxury car enthusiast to do? Marsha7,I think am going to wait for the second year or so on the new XJ series Jaguar. Just to see how it rates and if I like the new styling. I sure do want to see the new design though. 2jags2,Your right. The little debate ferarri11 and I had turned out not to be much about cars at all.merc1,Put that deposit down on that C-class yet? The dealers in Tampa say that they're do in this month.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Don't misunderstand, benzster. I said ""an"" ultimate HELM, not ""THE"" ultimate HELM. Certainly there are higher tiers and other incredible HELMs. The sophistication, however, of this upcoming LS600hL is unique in some ways, and it is historically noteworthy, IMO, and deserves respect for its accomplishments. The long wheelbase lshas good presence and elegance and it represents the most attractive Lexus I have seen to date. Most on this forum know that I have had my issues with Lexus styling blandness for a long time, but I think that this new one in the long wheelbase has finally reached a level of styling that I will not hammer. I have not seen the car in person, of course, but even though I am a huge Euro car fan, especially the German marques, I find this new Lexus LS600hL to be an amazing achievement, IMHO.Interesting you would reach to a Maybach to upstage it. And, yes, the Maybach is an ultimate HELM, no doubt.I don't think it will hurt some of us German car fans to give credit where it is due. Our favorite German cars are still awesome and will not be destroyed by this Japanese achievement. But I can not stand by and deny the LS600hL its proper accolades . . . particularly on its official debut day. There will be plenty of time to discover its true nature, pros abd cons, as time unfolds. TagMan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Don, ??I've always felt the 1990-1994 lswas fairly original and a timeless design. You wouldn't look at it and think it was a MB. (That's why I still keep my '92), but over the years, they've definitely resorted towards taking cues from theSClass. From the gated shifter to the profile of the OldSClass, Lexus hasn't been very original with LexusLS. Here's a quote from a Car and Driver Issue when the LexusLS came out, ""It seems Lexus has fired the ""Seiko"" designers who designed the original LexusLS, LexusES, and SCand brought in the Rolex knockoff artists"" ???Before the Lexus owners on this board cry foul, I own 2 lscars, a '92 and a '02 LexusLS. Even I have to admit, there is some truth to this quote. However, like most Lexus owners I feel I'm getting a higher quality car and a better ownership experience at a lower cost. Most people my age don't care about 0-60 times, Indycar like handling and other sports car cues. The LexusLS caters to the 45-50+ age group very well. They gave us a very comfortable car, with the latest in high tech wizardy and bulletproof reliability/service. And yes, if we want to pretend we're 20 again, we can stomp on the V-8 and get a very satisfying response..All you Lexus owners, is the above a fair characterization of what we want?Your thoughts would be appreciated, SV",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Easy to change the criteria to hide the truth isn't it? Aren't you the one that touted comparos about the LexusLS and LexusLS as one way to prove that they were superior?In the realm of GT cars the SC430 is a loser, it can't even get a victory over the XLR you love to hate. The XLR's problem is pricing, not that it sucks in general. Dominance is relative. Sales, brand equity, dynamics. There are many ways to exhibit greatness. True, and outside of the normal Lexus traits, which you could buy a Lexus sedan for, the SC430 fails miserably on other things people would buy a GT car for. The SCdoes the Lexus brand no favors, so ""brand equity"" is out and its ""dynamics"" are worst in class. Touting that the SC430 outsells the XLR pretty much goes back to what tagman said earlier. Isn't Lexus supposed to be the one that takes on the established leaders in any class and outsell them? That would be the SClass or XK, and the SClass has never had anything to worry about with the SCand starting this month neither does the XK. Forget talking about a 911. Outselling the XLR is non-accomplishment. Merc, you said if Lexus loses to a Mercedes, it's a loser! No, what I said was that even the mid-level, previous generation CLK430 Cabrio beat the SC430, meaning it wouldn't stand a chance against the current CLK500, or the upcoming CLK550 Cabrio much less the SL500->550. The SC430 update/replacement or whatever is next for it couldn't come soon enough. If sales are so important that means the previous generation Escalade was ""great"" too right along with the Camry. Can't point to sales one minute and comparos the next to put different models over. Its either a combination of the two (and many other factors) or nothing at all. You can't exclude one just because it doesn't help your case. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Don, ?You've illustrated my point. I don't think anyone who's driven a V-8 powered Lexus would call it sluggish in any means. Sure, the handling isn't indycar like, but who cares? It's not like we drive on the Autobahn everyday. Of course this is an objective thing, and when you drive a Supercharged Jaguar, I can see why you'd want to step on it..One more question, how's the XJ treating you? Any of those new car gremlins Jaguar used to be known for? I'm thinking about getting a plain XJ within 2 yrs and that's the only thing that is holding me back. Merc, ??Don't you think you're streching abit in saying the LexusLS looks like a newSClass? Your fanaticism is quite entertaining. Yes, I've seen EClass in person. and it does bear some resemblance to a Taurus. (I'm not saying the cars look EXACTLY the same here) If you were to tell me that the LexusLS is borrowing it's cues from the OLD SClass I'll buy it. Changing the marker lights to clear and extending the headlights makes the car look a little more aggressive. It's just a slight touchup. The RX and IS have clear lights too. Are they copying Honda? No...Don't tell me that MB is the first and only Automaker to put clear strips on their tailights..As for Lexus styling..Okay, the lstakes cues from an OLD SClass but what about the rest? The RX, LexusES, GX, GS, LX and SCare their own designs. While people say they're bland, they are still Lexus designs. The LexusES, GX, and RX don't borrow from anyone and they are the newest ones. I have no idea what the 2006 lswill look like, so the jury is out there.Happy Motoring, SV",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even better for the IS, please give a legit 6-speed to row your own to get maximum thrust out of the now ubiquitous 3.5L.More on the Lexus subject. I read on a Tokyo site where the upcoming lsmay offer a true Sport option, as in 750/60i Sport and Audi A8 Sport Pkg. with a 20"" wheel/tire option and 4 position electronic air suspension, much like Audi's 4-way adjustable air/pneumatic suspension. I surely hope this is true as the upcoming lsis hugely awaited. There is even talk that the 600H may have the Sport pkg. as standard. But very unlikely to be our standard offering on either model, much like how the European makes do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Every car company has to produce at least one lemon every now and then. Still, the statistics don't lie. 2-5% of CR subscribers reported problems with their '98 lss in all areas, while the A8, 7, and S have 10%+ problem rates in some areas for the newest rated model year. Thats a lot of people that have cars with no problems, but its still a lot more reported problems than an 8 year old Lexus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Everyone clearly knows that the Japanese are the biggest copy cats in the world. The Lexus LexusLS is the most ridiculous case of it yet. Total copy, and like someone said it's a bad copy of the OLD Mercedes design. Any bets that the new ES300 (2002) will look like the new SClass or C-Class? The LexusLS is a hell of a car, and you'd probably have to buy a loaded SClass orSClassto top it, but stylewise it's completely lacking. Even I admit it's a great car and it does deserve it's own look. I would like someone to please tell me where the Europeans or Americans have ever copied the styling of a Japanese car as blatantly as Lexus and Acura copies the Euro brands. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Everything is subjective. I personally like the way that the new A8 looks. It is not exactly revolutionary or edgy... However, I am not sure that seeking a revolutionary look or design is what makes marketing sense in the 70k luxury car segment.I find the A8 to be clean looking and sleek for a big car. IMHO, much more so than the current LexusLS, which Lexus is going to update a bit in the fall. I have driven the A8 a couple of times, and really like it. It is not a thrill ride, but it is a great driving vehicle for a big luxury car. I am also ""wowed"" by the interior, which is where I am going to be sitting most of the time.....For those thrill seekers that want a big Audi that thrills: wait for the S8 next year!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Excellent comments. The oldest LexusLS driver I know is 56 years old. When I bring my car in for service most others dropping cars off are in their 40's to early 50's in appearance. In my town which is a wealthy one you see plenty of ls's and SClass cars and it's probably a 50-50 ratio. It's the 7 and the Jag that you see only upon occassion. There are plenty of LX470's and TLC's at every school and sport event and uncountable ML's and RX's around that you see at every turn. Since I see many of the LexusLS and SClass cars at school and student affairs, and since most of them come from homes in the $1-5mln range it's obvious boo20's demographics don't work around here. They are not even remotely close. Anyone can put out a financial tool linking car price to some income threshhold but that hardly means that is who the car is being sold or marketed to. Secondly as syswei states why does it even have any relevance. For what it's worth someone I know well in the $100mln+ wealth range has an LexusLS, an LX470, 3 old MB's from the late 70's to the late 80's (two of which are SL's) and a VW beetle. He's 55 years old.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Don't worry, dude, you're even funnier!!How do I have access to soo many cars? I have friends/relatives/co-workers who have many different types. I have many enthusiast nuts.One friend of mine has had a 97/98 Z3 2.8 that he modified w:lightweight flywheel, exhaust, beefed up trans./18""Breyton wheels, Brembo brakes. Same guy later had 00 BMW 530i sport w/manual.before that VW Jetta VR6. Currently, has a Volvo S60R. I have driven all of them as he leases and doesn't really care how it's driven.ANother had the current gen. A4 Sport 6-speed for about 6 months, before that a MB C280(driven both).One relative has a stable of Lexi' 95 LexusES, 00 LexusLS, Father in law has a current gen. LexusLS, as well as a Benz ML320Other relative has a previous gen. 7Series.Otherwise, a friend works at Lexus NA in NJ. Been to ride and drive event with him in NJ where they Lexus products as well as competition. Driven them on a racetrack, slalom, wet braking, dirt braking, acceleration.Sorry, I have better things to do than waste salespeople's time, even though when I do it is quite fun to waste their time and listen to them hype their products up. you know how it is, bump up the horsepower numbers, make the car faster in 0-60time, etc. ""How many times have you had your honda appraised? Only reason that I ask is that I'm in the industry on the retail end and I'm in and out of dealers everyday and attend manufacturers events often.""WHat does that have to do with my car? But yes I've had it appraised. Thought about purchasing a Acura TSX last year but it sucked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Excellent point. Toyota's strategy with hybrids seems to be that Toyota branded hybrids will focus on fuel economy (although the Highlander hybrid works exactly the same as the RX400h) and Lexus hybrids will focus on performance. Honda doesnt seem to have any kind of strategy yet.Selling the ""performance hybrid"" to the public is going to be tough, as I think most people are like your friend, and think that hybrid = Prius. I think its still too early to determine whether people will buy hybrids (perfomrance oriented or otherwise) that arent rolling statements about the driver, ala Prius and Insight. The Accord has already proven that the performance hybrid idea doesnt work with a mainstream car. Whether it will work on a luxury car is up to the GS450h and LS600h.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Excellenty stated merc1! Like you I have driven most of the HELM vehicles at a special invite last year. The course included 30 minutes in each of the following: A8L, 7Series, LexusLS,SClass, XJ, and even the Phaeton. My observations are exactly like yours regarding the LexusLS. Attempt to corner with the boat at any speed other than grandma's and you might as well be sitting still. It is far away from anything the European HELMs offer in true handling, quality feel, and sport. Probably this is why th lsis popular in American and such a dud in Europe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fear not! Your annual Detroit Autoshow Report is here! ? First off I'll say that the show is getting to crowded. There simply isn't enough space for every maker to display all their products. Only the luxury brands will be elaborated on here. ? Audi - Each and every vehicle seemed to be a winner to everyone there. I personally love the new A6, grille and all. Ditto for the updated 2006 A4, and A8 W12. Speaking of the A8 W12, they had a special version present with a 17K Quattro GmBh ""Special Build"" package that contained special leathers, wood and a 4-seat package with the best interior of any car this side of a Maybach or Rolls-Royce. Stunning overall presentation. The new A3 Sportback is a very interesting car, it should do well if priced right. The A8 or Phaeton are my picks in their segment, not the SClass anymore. Everything was very upbeat at Audi. ? BMW - Not much new this year as far as styling or products, just updates to current models. The new 530ix models and of course the 500hp V10 M5. What a car! Now watch as it inhales the segment. Of the current BMW family on the M3 and 5Series are lookers to me, with the 6-Series being on the fence. ? Mercedes-Benz - It seems they didn't have enough space to display one of each model because my favorite Benz (the CL) wasn't present. Everyone was going ga ga over the CLS, a CLS55 AMG to be exact. Now a bit of catch-up here: I got a chance to see the CLS at a ""Love Mercedes"" event this past summer so Detroit wasn't my first time seeing it. Anyway, the CLS is a stunner and is the most expressively styled Mercedes sedan ever. I predict this car will easily sell the 8K units allocated for the U.S. Now for the not so good news, the M-Class. The new M-Class while improved over the current vehicle (how could it not be) didn't get the attention that a new Mercedes-Benz should get. The CLS, CLK, SL, SLR, E, and even the aged SClass all got way more attention. Having the new ML's locked (at least on this day) probably didn't help matters any. Either way I wasn't really too impressed by it. I predict a lukewarm response in the marketplace for it. There is something missing compared to MB's cars. The two ""Sport Tourer"" concepts were talked about too, with the larger R-Class (as it will be called come Geneva) getting most of the attention. I think the smaller fwd B-Class is a mistake in the U.S. The SL65 and G-Class were in a corner of the display causing major problems for people trying to cram in that space to see them. As usual the foot traffic at Mercedes was the heaviest of the lot. ? Jaguar - Another example of a cramped display space. You can't get a decent picture or profile of any of their cars because of the space provided and the way they are arranged within said space. Anyway, the ""Advanced Lightweight Coupe"" concept is the next Jaguar XK. While a good looking car for sure, it comes off as a junior Aston-Martin. I was kinda hoping for more daring from Jaguar. Love the XJ and current XK models, classics. The X-Type needs to be thrown away, imo. ? Lexus - Finally a Lexus badged vehicle (production or concept) that looks like something you'd actually want to drive. The LF-A is almost there, sleek and all but the nose and details need work. That said the basic shape and stance is the best of any Lexus concept vehicle yet. The rear end with its cooling fans exposed is pure aggression and the interior is sports car correct. As for the production cars, still all yawners to me. The new GS didn't impress either, it actually manages to look worse than the 1998-2005 model. The big news is that the hybrid GS (GS450h) will be shown at the New York autoshow in April and judging by the repsonse to the RX400h in Detroit it should be a hit. ? Infiniti - Well it is official. Infiniti has joined the list of luxury car brands in favor with me. It goes Mercedes, Audi, BMW and then you guessed it a Japanese upstart named Infiniti. The M35/45 are the best products from any Japanese maker yet to challenge the E/5Series dominated middle segment. I predict that the M twins are going to be a hit just like the G. One thing though, in the recent roadtest of the M45 in Car and Driver, they mention an ""ATM"" like dasboard. I sat in the car thinking they were exactly right..it really does look like an ATM machine. Didn't like that at all, and the rear end will take some getting used to, but those are minor things and shouldn't hinder the car in the market. The G35 Coupe has gotten expensive at 40K loaded. Youch! Infiniti has all likeable cars except one, the unloved and very little attention getting Q45. It is as ugly as ever for 2005. The FX35/45 are still unique in the market and continue to excite. ? Bentley - I continue to be the only person I know that doesn't like their darling Continental GT Coupe. Three years on and I still don't like it. Give me an Arnage. I see that the sedan version of the Continental GT, the Continental Flying Spur was shown today and will debut at Geneva in March. I'm still thinking its ugly, but we'll see. As usual all oohs and ahhs from behind the rails that always seperate the Bentleys from the masses. ? Maybach - For some reason this year people were behaving like they've never seen these cars before. I didn't understand it. Anyway, they had the car's doors open with a live jazz performance playing on the dual DVD screens and the sound was amazing. The Maybach 62 is still mis-proportioned to my eye, the 57 is the model to have if you must. ? Aston-Martin - Nothing new this year except the hi-po Vanquish S. It takes an expert to spot the differences between it and the ""regular"" Vanquish. Crowds the same a Bentley. ? Cadillac - I'll try to boil this one down a little. For those of you that have never been to Detroit, it is still an American car town by far. Cadillac like the rest of GM seems to really trying to compete at every level, or at least that was the feeling I got at the Cadillac display. The 440hp Supercharged STS-V is a car after my own heart. While I don't care for the looks of any of these new Cadillac it seems that they are really on their way. The same engine/6-speed automatic combo will be available in the XLR-V to be shown in New York in April. These two cars while not world beaters will go a long way towards giving Cadillac the boost they've needed for the last 30 years. I applaud their effort. ? Rolls-Royce - The most reserved display. Just one Phantom and I didn't see the 100EX concept there either. Very quiet. ? ?? continued....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ferraris and such shouldn't be in the resale list, because they're often bought for investment & pleasure, not transportation.

"First of all anyone who is says Audi is not luxury automobile company doesn't know squat about automobiles. That is the most ignorant comment I have ever heard. Aside from many opinions posted here by Lexus fans thinking they actually know anything about other brands...like the guy asking whether Audi had heated seats. Not only do you get heated seats in an Audi, but you get a dual DVD rear entertainment center with a refrigerator on the Audi a8 to boot. Get real with some of these ridiculous comments regarding Audi! Get the facts before you spew biased BS! First of all, a ""True"" luxury or premier automobile maker is determined by their presence on the world stage, not their existence in one market of the world. That said, Audi, not to mention BMW and Mercedes-Benz outsell Lexus at least 4 to 1 worldwide. In Europe a Lexus is viewed as the ""Schweinmobile"" or the ""pig car"" because of its design. Europeans who buy Lexus usually cannot afford an Audi, BMW, or Mercedes-Benz. It is third choice to Europeans, if a choice at all with those sales numbers. Lexus has strived for a long time to establish itself in Europe with no success as Europeans require driving dynamics in their cars and a world heritage. The comment that Lexus will take over Europe is really out of touch. Lexus hopes to hit 40,000 units by 2010 according those great Toyota gods of yours. Lexus managed 20,000 in sales in Western Europe for 2004 vs. 560,000 for Audi alone. Yes, Audi sells less in the US, but at least they sold 80,000 units to Lexus 280,000 or so in NA, and this is a bigger market than Europe (not by much though) I will refrain from comparing an lsto A8L,7Series, or SClass as true auto enthusiasts know the difference easily. Also, Lexus lacks any true motor sport heritage, a very important aspect to a true marquee. I mean one could write books on Audi's motor sport prowess and heritage, yet alone to add BMW and Mercedes-Benz to the mix. Audi was winning endurance rallies in 1912 already, not to mention dominance of the current Le Mans, SCCA, DTM, and the list goes on. Lexus may be reliable (though, there has been some interesting recalls on the lsrecently), it seems that is what Lexus fans can only talk about - how reliable their Lexus is. The Germans are quite reliable as well. Lexus people would like everyone to believe that the German UberKlasse (Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz) are breaking down all the time or something. That is simply Lexus BS! I have owned 8 Audis, including three A8Ls, and the only thing I ever did is change oil. I have driven your precious little lsand if anyone thinks that it compares to an A8L, then I have some nice swamp land to sell you. Lexus is defintely a great poser on the world stage. Hey, it doesn't even exist in Japan, its own hometown. What really sets the German UberKlasse apart from Lexus is the passion of its owners. We have car clubs the world over dedicated to our marquees. We run our cars on tracks. Try an Audi S4 or Audi RS6 or a BMW M3 or BMW M5 sometime if you want to know what REAL driving is about. We know our marquees were built for driving and handling. We push them like no senior citizen pushs his Lexus to the Senior Citizen Center. Our cars have to take much more abuse than any Lexus or other Japanese poser. I would love to run one of your IS things around a track, but then I am not sure it could handle it. Plus I love my Quattro! You can sell more cars in the US (only), and claim whatever you want, but you will never understand what makes a true premium luxury marquee. It is much more than just leather seats and some stupid pollen filter. That does not make a marquee. Audi, BMW, Jaguar, and Mercedes-Benz are true marquees based on the inate qualities that they possess. Someday Lexus might have that, but you have to do better on the world stage and actually try to compete head to head on the racetrack. I give credit to poor little Cadillac that tried so hard to take on the mighty Audi RS6s last year in the SCCA Championships. At least they understand what it takes to be a true marquee. So go sell more Lexus'- who honestly cares.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First of all I never said that every Lexus was a copy of a Benz. Never said any such thing. I said the lswas. 2-3 out of 20 may be nothing to you (obviously) but it proves my point, which was that Toyota is in no postion to sue anyone over styling issues. Like their styling is unique compared to the Koreans. Nobody said their whole lineup was guilty of anything so your pointless challenges are just that, pointless. You proved my point a few posts ago, there exists some Toyota knock-offs. End of story. I ascribe your dismissal of a car like the ES330 being ugly because that is what your fav specializes in. Comes with the job. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First off, congrats on the new A8. A very fine automobile. Beautiful interior, maybe the finest interior of all lux-cars sold here in the US. ? ...take a look at what options are available in an A8, S, or 7. take a good hard look. these are upscale luxury cars. the LexusLS is just not in the same league... ? I have taken a good hard look at these options and fail to see what makes the A8/S/7 *more upscale* than the LexusLS. Only thing I saw were AWD (A8)/4Matic (S). Care to tell us what else makes your German makes more upscale than the LS? Please don't say looks..... ? Oh, I get it: a need to justify your new purchase. ? ah ah ah ah ah ah",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First off, the car's initial run will be astonishing, especially in light of it's American and European competition not offering any similar models as of now(albeit don't count out MBZ, a stallwart for surprises).However, for the long-term standings, as with any car, it loses steam. And with this being a specialty car, it will lose it even faster. With the Europeans undoubtly focusing on diesel-hybrid technology and with some diesels(ie: Bluetec and TDI) on the market now that offers remarkably better gas mileage and about the same smoothness without the hybrids gripes(ie: trunk space and unknown longevity for exp.-altho pre-'04 Priuses are still running strong) is some indication that the lshas it work cut out for it.And it doesn't have nuch of a calling card except for the L on it's nose. Not much in power(430 is not a lot in light of 500/600-hp MB's. Projected fuel economy ratings not impressive. Some technology, altho not breakthrough(I do think is the first AWD sedan hybrid, tho.)But it has one trump card that Lexus has played since '89: PRICE. With a projected start around $95k, it shouldn't be a tuff sell at all.......",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First, people who buy and love the LexusLS need not ""rationalize"" anything. They are going with what they, the Auto Media, the Consumer Media, and the main stream Media consider to be the ""Best Luxury Vehicle made"".Second, why is choosing a vehicle that happens to be the least expensive ""Buying Down""???Using that sort of thinking (which I am loathe to do), a BMW 7Series buyer would be ""Buying Down"" also as it's price is $700 under the MSRP of $70,079 for my LexusLS.And someone who goes in to Starbucks to get their favorite coffee are ""Buying Down"" by getting their choice of brewed coffee instead of the espresso based coffees? After all, he's getting something that costs three times less than the ""Latte"".It's snobbish and condescending remarks like that, 92735i, that further prove the mind-set of ""European Mark Only"" folks, and in particular, ""BMW Only"" folks.It also proves my ongoing point that ""European Mark Only"" folks are FOR THE MOST PART interested mainly in having a vehicle for show factor.I'm sure mine is the first post of many you'll get in response to that obnoxious statement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"                Footie? ""squashed A8 look""? that's funny? actually, I think the previous generation A8 was one of the best sedan styles ever made! Don't like the new one though, it's too rough-hewn IMO.Ljflx? yes, there are a lot of things I like about the LS? interior, reliability, and of course the passion of all you Lexus nut jobs ;-)? I find the exterior only acceptable though? I'm rooting for the next design bigtime? want to see the longer wheel base and finer features. BTW, with this pedestrian safety BS I'm not sure how much we can expect. A Train? are you a Duke Ellington fan or just stuck with a certain daily NYC itinerary? FWIW I like all earth-tone interiors, particularly saddle. I don't know the ins and outs of Lexus but according to the website it seems saddle isn't offered with the LexusLS. If it is available however I wouldn't hesitate a minute to get it but not with black or blue. You pay a premium to get saddle (aka brown) with a Porsche. I think it works great with a medium grey metallic exterior? Briarwood, Cypress and Mystic Gold and the silvers on the LS? YES THE SILVERS!            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OTOH, the lsand Audi are competing in the full size, luxury sedan space, and hence everything about them must attract the buyer in that space. Fun looking takes second priority over luxurious features and ergonomics. That is where, IMO, Lexus trumps Audi. The lsinterior exudes quality and luxury. The Audi says ""German"", spartan, matter-of-factly, and round knobs for controling everything. Not my cup of tea !Like I said, the Audi A8 ain't burning down dealers doors, are they ? The buying public speaks loudly on what they want and prefer, and the A8 ain't even close to its competitors. Maybe the interior ergonomics (besides the all aluminum body) have a role in its lack-luster sales performance ???            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                For all this talk about how the car looks like a BMW, you guys have missed the real LS460 twin, the 2007 Toyota Camry.  They share nearly identical rear-end designs:Can you even tell which is which without looking at the obvious extra length of the LS460L? The same interior design:Again, the Lexus' interior design is nothing more than a grander Toyota with more buttons/features.   Here are the links for both cars.  They look exactly alike in nearly every way except for the front end grille treatment!  Check out the last pic for the Toyota Camry's interior.  Lexus grade for sure, too bad it looks so similar. 2007 Camry2007 LS460Wow just as the LS460 tries to escape its ""big Camry"" stigma, Toyota goes and re-designs both cars with nearly identical styling cues!  What does this do to all the L-Finesse talk?  I thought Toyota had goofed when the gave the Camry Solara coupe the same look as the SC430, but this is ridiculous.  I can't wait to read the denials (excuses) about this one, should be great reading! Forget looking like a 7Series BMW, the LS460 is nothing more than a giant Camry with an idential booty and very similar sides, with a prettier (how could it not be compared to this new Camry, double yuck!) grille and lights. So much for the exclusivity argument and the belief that Toyota and Lexus have totally seperate design studios.  Obviously someone walked down the hall to see what the other studio was doing! Prestige?  Out the window when it comes to looking unique, and this was supposed to be a good looking, Lexus-specific design? NOT! Long live the Giant Toyota! M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                For all those who think price has no effect on sales.  Here is just a quick look at MB and Lexus model pricing.

SLK - 40,320 to 56,170 with 3 models  Avg SLK price = $47,420SL - 89,520 to 126,970 with 3 models.  Avg SClass price = $112,420. ML - 36,670 to 47,120 with 2 models.  Avg ML price = $42,895. G-Class - 77,620 to 94,170 with 2 models.  Avg G price = $85,895. There is no ML55 and one model in the C-Class is the 2004 C32, the 2005 C55 hasn't been released yet. Lexus has 10 models from $29,980 - 65,100.  Average price = $44,968. These models include the GX470, GS300, GS430, LexusLS, SC430, ES330,  RX , IS300 Sedan, IS300 Sportback, and LX470. The average Mercedes-Benz is $67,646 compared to the average Lexus at $44,968 and this doesn't make a difference because of prestige?   I can't believe anyone here believes that. I didn't even go into 4Matic MB models and which tranny the IS has or whether or not you select the FWD or AWD  RX .  When you include every trim the average Benz price only rises even higher while Lexus' stays about the same. The bottom line is that once you get past the C/E/ML and CLK from Mercedes and the ES/IS/RX/GS from Lexus these two are NOT playing the same pricing game.  How on earth could sales ever favor Mercedes is beyond me.  Prestige doesn't mean anything if you don't have the loot to step up to an S, CL, SL, or G which Lexus has nothing in the same range, price wise. Lexus only has the LX and lsthat play above 55K, while MB has the S, CL, SL, G, and certain E/CLK models.  How could this pricing not affect MB sales?Just a quick glance at Audi, Jaguar, BMW, Acura, Infiniti, Cadillac and Lincoln's websites reveals that nobody else is even close in pricing.  BMW comes the closer than anyone else, but they don't have the depth of models.  Despite selling the largest number of expensive cars MB is either 3rd or 4th in sales and that is seen as a crisis or some type of failure.  That is ridiculous.  Just looking at their pricing alone they shouldn't even be a contender in the sales race. To suggest that MB having more models means they should be reaching more customers is not valid either.  These models that they have ""more"" of are mainly skewed towards the top end not the bottom.  The  buyers get thinner as you go up and MB's lineup is weighted towards the top end.

The RX is the trendsetter in its niche, not a ""copy.""  The GS doesn't look like anything else, and neither does the IS.  The LX?  Looks like the TLC, but everything else in the market has followed them.As for the RR, I did see it on Motorweek, and thought it was just hideous on the outside.  Really atrocious.  One of the great, elegant traditional styles butchered.  Forward of the C pillar, however, the 7 looks better and better to me.  I love the looks of the interior.  i Drive and poor reliability would keep me from buying one though, as would that unsightly tush.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"                Edmund's car comparator is a good tool for comparing car's features, specs and pricing.A comversation with a local realtor made me go take a look at the market another way.I think there is another way to look at the luxury lineup.  Instead of arguing about pricing differences in traditional market segments,  compare cars on the basis of similar sizes, performance, efficiency, warranty, etc.  Then look to see what ones in that class cost.This is the way the majority of non-luxury cars are done - where entry means small and midsize means midsize.I did this an found that Lexus doesn't do well with the IS300 as a small luxury car offering, while Infiniti does.  The LexusES is too large to be a 'small' car.Here's my small luxury car comparo:MBCClass YTD sales 21.3K unitsBMW 3Series YTD sales 34.4K unitsInfiniti G35 YTD sales 23.5K unitsIS 300 YTD sales 3.5K units  <--- only one in class that doen't offer AWDHere's my midsize luxury car comparo:MBEClass YTD 17.3K unitsBMW 5Series YTD sales 14.7K unitsLexus ES330 YTD sales 24.1K unitsGS fits here too 2.5K unitsHere's my large size luxury car comparo:MB SClass YTD Sales 5.5K unitsBMW 7Series YTD Sales 5.3K unitsLexus lsYTD Sales 10.5K unitsThis pretty much lines up cars with similar features, specs, performance and size.?I think that consumers have figured out that the traditional definitions of entry, mid and premium for the luxury market is way off the mark in terms of the value proposition.I asked a realtor friend yesterday why she had a new Lexus 330 and not a Mercedes E.  She said, ""same or better features, rock solid reputation, 1/2 the lease price.""  So why not get aCClass.  ""Too small"".IMHO, the MB.s aren't class leaders in anything but high price.

"                I was reading some of the past discussions and saw that you were comparing the E55, M5, RS-6 and XJR(or as you said more appropriately the S type R).  Since I last posted I've been giving consideration to getting an RS-6 instead of an A8L.  If you're wondering why I seem to stick with Audi it's because they're running a lease special where you can turn over an existing Audi lease about a year early without any charge.  So I want to trade up from an A6 4.2.  For those who wonder why anyone would want to go from 0 to 60 in 5 seconds with the kids in the back seat realize that the kids are only in the back seat maybe 20% of the time.  The problem is they're big kids. What do you guys think.  And does anyone know if there will be a 2004 RS-6?            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Check the MB website if you don't believe it. Thats funny you have to compare the acceleration of the LexusLS to the SL500.  Is Lexus really that bad off? When and if Lexus' hybrids actually make V8 power and V6 gas mileage a reality,  I'll be the first to congratulate them, until then however it's just wait and see. Still reading through the posts.  RE: #3153. Do we have to go through this innovation and technology thing again?  When are you going to realize that your list of what you think Lexus does so well aren't innovations?   Do you not realize that Mercedes is responsible for your Lexus' ABS, crumple zones, stability control etc? You gave your list of things in reply to what boo20 said about technology.  What in the world is technical about customer service, which you try to list twice as service and then customer service. Value? What does that have to do with technology?  Thats good marketing.  You're confused as to what innovations and technology are. Hybrid technology is just that, technology and innovation. The adaptive headlights were on sale here FIRST by Lexus with their 04'  RX , but you do realize that certain 04' BMW and Mercedes models will also have these?   We're not talking about the years lag like when Lexus finally gets something Mercedes has had for years, like Keyless Go.  They're basically being introduced by all three brands for the same model year, if no the exact same month. BTW, JDP can't tell you what every MB dealer has in stock.  Only the larger-volume, more affluent area dealers are going to have SLs in stock.    boo20, ""Another reason people may be waiting for the '04EClass is because this is the first ?year that MB is bringing back the legendary E 500. The '03s are only available with 3.2 and 4.3 L engines.""You're letting them force you to spread yourself too thin.  The 03'EClass was available as a E500 model.  sv7887, The car, like practically any other, requires an Oil change every 5000-7500 miles. Any decent mechanic will tell you frequent oil changes are probably one of the best things you can do for you car. Obviously, the Duration depends on how much you drive.Right and Wrong.  Wrong as far as Mercedes goes.  The FSS (Flexible Service System) computes when a service is do, unlike Lexus which needs an oil change every 5000-7K miles, a Mercedes doesn't.  Mercedes also specifies synthetic for all its cars no, so no they don't go back for service every 5-7K miles like any other other.   You're right as duration dictates the service interval, of which a Lexus can't determine for itself.  The Lexus way is low tech in this reguard.   Did you know that a very much dissed American car brand has the technology to read it's own oil and determine the service interval?   ""As for the Seven Speed Issue...Don't you think this is overkill? I don't see anyone else rushing to adopt a 7 Speed Transmission. Even a high performance car like a Corvette, Aston MartinVanquish, and Porsche 911 only have six speeds and can probably beat anything MB has to offer.""At first I would honestly say YES.  However if the new trans delivers on it's promise of better acceleration and fuel economy whats not to like?    The Corvette doesn't compete with any Mercedes, so whats the point of bringing it up?   The Aston Martin Vanqish gets beat by a the SL55 AMG, with it's 5-Speed, so image what will happen when AMG tweaks the 7speed for their cars.    The 911 Turbo in automatic form I guess you could say competes with the SL55 or SL600, but they are vastly different types of cars.   Yes the 911 TT is faster than either, but it should be considering it's 1000lbs weight advantage.   The SClass is a GT car, the 911 is a purebread sports car.  When you want to compare the GT cars (you know actual competitors to the SL55) to each other, let me know and I'll show you where you can read about the awesome SL55 AMG and it's capabilites.The real test of the new 7speed will be in the E500,SClass, SClass, SL500 and CL500, when they are tested by the automags and prospective buyers. You're knocking Mercedes for going further because Lexus doesn't and isn't a leading innovator. It's the same old story, unless Lexus comes up with it, it doesn't matter.  Mercedes is bringing a 7speed to the market for the same reason Lexus is bringing a 6sp to the market, better acceleration, fuel economy and just more all around flexibility, and lastly competition.   Truth be told, a 5-speed trans is more than an ""enough"" in these cars, or are you telling me the current 5-speed in the LexusLS is so lousy that a 6-speed was actually ""needed""?  I know that wasn't the case.  If Mercedes is bringing needless tech to the market then so is Lexus, and Lexus is doing it ""late"" as usual. ljflx, Now as always I look forward to your take on this issue, but there are a couple of things you've missed.  These surveys.  I don't know what you think Mercedes' problems is specifically, but you seem to think that these are breakdowns by the side of the road. Now when it comes to Mercedes...........and before you say it....I'm not saying that this simple stuff is causing their downfall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Given my experience with the RX400h,the handling on the LexusLS hybrids will be top notch. The reason is that batteries in the rear provide balanced weight distribution and the center of gravity is considerably lower. Let me deviate and comment on all the horsepower claims. An example is the new V10 used in upcoming Audis. The peak horsepower is achieved at 7000 rpm. High revving engines are not going to last very long and require meticulous maintenance. The same remarks apply to the BMW powerplant used in the M5. One of the best features of the Toyota/Lexus hybrid synergy system (which is unique according to the UN definition of ""hybrid"") is the excellent midrange acceleration achieved at nore moderate rpms. The engine in the LS460h has dual injection, port and direct, which allows higher compression ratios and thus lower fuel consumption. Moreover the 8 speed transmission which appears to have a duel range, power and cruise, should also yield fuel efficiency. It has taken a huge investment by Toyota to achieve this and, unfortunately, no other manufacturer could afford to make such an investment; hence all the bad-mouthing by various auto executives.

"In my humble opinion, the LexusLS is the most luxurious car in the ultra-luxury class, especially with its interior and smooth ride quality.

"                Good for you if you're extremely happy with your A8. The point of the JDP data is that you're in a minority among A8 owners; the average A8 owner only gives his car 3 out of 5 stars on non-reliability issues.  ? BTW, as brightness04 suggested, does your V8 feel ""more luxurious"" to you because the car also comes in a W12, even though you don't own one?  I guess then if I bought a C230, I could feel ""more luxurious"" because MB also makes anSClass, right?  ? Also, just what does an LWB version of an A8 get you?  More interior room than an LS?  Nope, 107 cu ft vs 107.  More trunk space?  Nope, 20.2 cu ft for the lsvs 14.6.  ? The Germans are soooo great at engineering...why can't they engineer more space in a LWB SEDAN?

"                good morning merc1,i did quite a bit of searching about this non- sense of which automobile is safer.  the previous A8 was the only luxury sedan to receive 5 stars for the driver and passenger.  the current version has yet to be tested.  much was made about the ignition temperature of the aluminum skin.  one poster on another site made the point that there are plenty of items to burn well before the aluminum would on an A8.  sounds reasonable to me. also when it comes to safety....all of the active and passive safety systems on the A8 make it at the very least equal to any other automobile in this class.  in your post about sales numbers.....  Lexus's numbers sink even lower if you remove the re badged Land Cruiser.  like i mentioned many many posts ago...the LexusLS, GS, IS, and SCare the only true Lexus specific designs.  these are the numbers that should be counted.  and i know this pisses a lot of people off.  my point is not to knock the quality of the cars they design and sell but to merely compare it to the strength and breadth of the MB's lineup.  at this point in time there is no comparison between the two brands in what they offer the high end buying customer.

"                Good news, bad news. First the good - I just got something from MB in the mail with a cover page that said there were special deals and incentives on the SClass (which I hear are not selling well right now) as well as the E andCClass cars. I have seen SClass deals (generally $77K stickers) at $799 per month on a $12K lease deal with $2K down advertised (about a month ago) and 4-matic is no extra charge in 2005. So you should be able to get a great deal. Bad news - My wife threw the MB mail piece out before I looked at it.Phaeton - $549-649 in NJ with 0 down and no lease application fee. Driveaway is basically your first months lease fee + Motor vehicle fees.A8 - about 950 a month on a 12-15K mile lease with zero down. Someone I know is looking at one. I just forgot if the miles were 12 or 15K.Good luck and be careful with that Phaeton. It may be on its last legs. Problem is it's the same car as the A8 pretty much so why pay 350-400 a month more? Plus the VW probably has the better lux ride. I've driven the Audi twice - once on a test and it was harsh and again on a 350 mile spin (less harsh but I just wasn't impressed as it lacks the lux ride of the Benz S or Lexus ls). Finally Audi service by me is as bad as VW so that doesn't cut it for the extra bucks - at least not here.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Good observation. Just what MB needed&#151;American retro thrown into a club sandwich that already has Japanese and English influence. Throw the RX-8 in there too. I believe they are the ones who started this SUV-fender nonsense. Would be funny if Lexus decided to jump on the bandwagon and L-finessed it into the LexusLS. I sure hope not. However, from all of the conceptual fanfare that we've seen from them up to this point, it would seem this will not be the case. As SV said, they have the Pokemon thing going. I cracked up when I read that.As Wale_bate said in another thread, all manufacturers are searching for the next big thing.

"                Good point ripn.  Q45s have had, especially the 97-01s, TERRIFYING depreciation.Unless you're leasing (I.E. LexusLS may do better than an XJL resale-wise but the Jag leases better due to subvention) that's something that people just dont pay close enough attention to.For my money, the XJ is an awfully good buy.

"                Good points, but I think they've tasted too much sales success to go back to the old way of building cars.  One MB rep told me a few years ago when the ML was being introduced at an auto show that Mercedes-Benz envisions a Benz of some time in every garage - urgh! Some have suggested that they'll try to do both.  You know keep the volume models, but make more exclusive variants of each.  This seems to be what they're doing now, but I'm not so sure about that strategy.  Sure a CL65 is great, but the plain-jane C320 needs more in common with such a car as far as build is concerned imo.   Their gee-whiz models have long been at the top, it's the everyday cars that need the improvements to me.   I mean really who has cars like the CL, SL, SLR and SClass AMG and V12 models all under one brand?   Now lets concentrate on making the C, ML, and R-Classes right.  I've long believed that  EClass  typifies the Mercedes-Benz experience, you know the quintessential Benz, that doesn't cost a whole lot. Question - have you actually seen the new Audi grille design in person or are you going by the some of the press' reaction to it?  I like it on the A8, but I haven't see the new A6 in person yet. b4z, I don't think anyone has mentioned Cadillac because they don't play in this area of the market, over 60K.  They sold more luxury vehicles last year?  You must mean that 40K cut-off stuff right?  This is one of the most made up statistics I've ever seen, and it is done so for Cadillac or whatever brand is trying to measure itself.   A 38K car isn't luxury, but a 40K one is?  Come on now.  Real luxury is 50K and up, in my most humble of opinions.  You know cars that a lot can't afford. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Good points.   This Japanese onslaught happened 20+ years ago with regular cars and Detroit survived, barely.  The British as a whole had their entire automotive industry collaspe and wind up in German (VW, BMW) or American (Ford) hands.   Think about it, Jaguar, Rolls-Royce, Bentley, and Aston-Martin....some of the most prestigious names in the history of the automobile are no longer British owned.  The difference is that Germany is the driving automotive force in Europe and they aren't going to just roll over, they'll at some point re-invent themselves to deal with all these new challenges. The one I'm the most worried about overall is BMW.  This styling is going to catch up with them at some point.  So far they have stood by their design department's (Chris Bangle didn't even personally draw the 6-Series or X3 people, only the 7Series was truly ""his"") new styling direction.  The real test will be the 2006 3Series.  Will they destroy the most critically acclaimed car in the 30-40K bracket just for the sake of change?  We'll find out in Sept of 2005. The 2005 Frankfurt autoshow will also reveal the nextSClass, which certain people are desperately hoping turns out to be an ugly car.  You're right about Acura.  They're limited not by talent, but by Honda's smaller is better thinking and smaller budget compared to Nissan and Toyota.   A shame really because a big rwd Acura with a Vtec V8 sounds really nice.   In theory they could do to Lexus what Lexus did to Mercedes, but to execute this will require a fundamental shift in Honda thinking, that isn't going to happen. I think the brands to watch with varying degrees are Audi, Cadillac, Infiniti, Lexus and Mercedes-Benz.   BMW has a new 3Series coming, but after that things will cool down for them somewhat.   Audi will introduce a new model every year from now until 2008!  A new TT, A6, A6-based Coupe (think Novoluari Concept), S8, RS6, updated 2005.5 A4, RS4, and a production version of the LeMans Quattro.  All Audi needs to do is improve reliability because unlike BMW their designs make all Japanese and some European cars look like toasters and refrigerators. Cadillac is working on a 100K+ car to compete with theSClasss of the world.  They'll have performance variants of the CTS, STS, XLR, and possibly the SRX.   There is a new smaller Cadillac on the drawing board for Europe.  Naturally the car I'm most interested in seeing is this 100K car they keep talking about.   Unfortunately I don't see Cadillac becoming the ""Standard of the World"" again though.   The XLR and CTS just aren't the worldbeaters they promised.  Cadillac will gain a lot of attention with all the new product, but unless it is executed right....Lexus has a new LexusLS, GS, HPX (don't think for one moment this crossover won't be built), and most importantly a new IS.  I think the next IS is the most important upcoming product launch for them, not the LexusLS, GS or the hybrids.  Why?  Because this is type of car that BMW sells over 100K of each year.  Lexus currently stands at 12-15K a year.  They want to desperately crank up those numbers.  A new IS Coupe, Sedan, Convertible and Wagon are very critical to Lexus' 350K a year sales goal.   After Lexus, Cadillac and Audi...there is Infiniti on the watch list.   The new M35/45 should do better than the current car.  How could it not?  Infiniti's biggest problem is Lexus.  When people go looking for a truly upscale Japanese car, Lexus' lsis the one on their list, not the Q45.  How does Infiniti turn that around?   The next generation Skyline is coming here in 2007 as a Infiniti.  If Infiniti is smart they'll do a G35 convertible and a hi-po version....a G45 Sedan with the 4.5L V8 tweaked for at least 350hp to take on the M3/S4/C55 etc. On a different note I predict the Koreans will introduce a luxury division complete with a real rwd V8 luxury car in about 10 years at the rate they're going.

"                Excellent point. Toyota has finally taken a stand on what America sees as style. The upright and conservative approach has been out for at least a decade, and with Lexus giving even the flagship lsa curve or two has to be taken very seriously. Take a look at the IS, which may or may not be as lithe on it's feet as the 3Series, but it does one up it in the styling category. It makes the 3 look (dare I say it), staid and conservative, even in light of the Bangle Assault on Munich. The GS has lost it's upright and overly boxy butt in favor of an ultra-modern look and clean, swooping design that evokes major attitude. But the biggest change of them all has to reside with the LexusES, which makes the '06 model look like a discount rental model, IMO. Lexus has finally given the bread and butter car a much more appropiate and appreciative styling design, particularly discarding the fish-mouth look. The overall appearance of the car both inside and out is very remarkable. And it now has the performance(semi maybe) to give it some poise on the road.BUT, as you duly noted, the Euro cars are ever evolving, with Mercedes and Audi finally abandoning the traditional style in favor of ultra-modern and hip styling, especially M-B. Never would I thought they'd take the classic S to this level, which has apparently paid off. And the styling of the GL is so good that M-B managed to hide it's incredible size and weight by giving it more curves and creases. Audi is on a mission too. The Q7 for instance is a far cry from the tradition of the company, and the upcoming R8 and A8's will definetely give car nuts like ourselves something to talk about.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
                Great post. I came very close to the 2001  SClass but in the end I couldn't pull the trigger for the simple reason that I didn't trust the car to be reliable and the 2001 LexusLS was equal or better anyway. But I did love the S styling. Something is always wrong when a company is not delivering on the tenets it was established on. Now - nearly 5 more years of Lexus perfection in 3 different vehicles makes it almost impossible to think about switching. I have no doubt that the cars will stay perfect for another 1-2 years and that the 2007 lswill be perfect for it's lease duration when I take it. That's the way MB buyers thought in the past and that foundation rock is gone. The fact that the 2007 lslooks to be the far better looking car in pix (TO ME - plus the S looks worse and worse with every pix I see) so far and with higher level technology in the lshybrid (and likely no stupidity with an i-drive clone) is also a big advantage. MB can't pull off simple electronics so a battery is going to be a  lot harder to swallow. The Germans are starting to look like a group of beached whales to me. One puts in i-drive and everyone else follows suit even though it's despised by the market and the reviewers.Lastly - where is the stability of the brands styling? We went from an in your face bulk look with the S to a svelte styling that was revolutionary and did everything in its power to hide the bulk and now we are back to in your face bulk. Merc1 says he reads that the bulk is hidden in the 2007 S but everything I read says the opposite and the rear of the car looks pregnant to my eyes. So I see a simple thing here - a brand searching for its reliability roots in an electronics era where the country of origin has weaknesses (this is Japan's forte) plus a brand that is searching for how its marquee car should look. It's incredible to me that the S looks stale before it's even released. The evolution of the car should almost be changed so that the 2007 is the 2001 and the 2001 is the 2007. Then at least I'd know what styling direction they're going in.            ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If I'm a Lexus dealer I want that car here tomorrow and if I'm a Chrysler dealer I want the Imperial production starting tomorrow. An AWD Crown Majesta here will be a smash hit IMO and given it's more LexusES in size it would be viewed as a smaller LexusLS. Now if they make that car become the next LexusES and restyle it with L-finesse than the LexusES sales - which are already quite high -  will surge. I've read in a number of places the new LexusES will be distinctly different than the Camry, so maybe it's a possibility.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"                Had lunch today with a business buddy of mine who has a 2000 7Series l and has been a BMW fanatic for as long as he has been able to afford them. He's had several problems with the car but they were mainly minor ones. He would ordinarily be an auto roll-over for the 7 when his lease ends next year. But he's besides himself on the new design. Somehow he looks at it and sees an elongated Lexus GS. I always saw an elongated Passat but what the heck. He's so upset about it that he wrote BMW and he also told me he probably buys out his existing car next year. He's simply not an S or LexusLS fan. I told him to go to the S-8 but he dooesn't trust Audi workmanship.  Given the fact he's a new car freak and usually takes 30-36 month leases it's a shocker to me he may buy out his leased car. I think you are right in your opinoion that the ""real"" BMW people will avoid the car and are wondering what to do right now. Btw - he won't even think about the VW Phaeton.  Do you really think they will roll that design out to the 5 and 3Series?Haven't seen the new Range Rover but on paper it looks pretty awesome. I never did care for the old one and in my town all you seem to see is LX470's and TLC's in the bigger suv's and various ML's and the RX300 (those things are everywhere it seems) in the smaller ones. The X-5 is also getting a good foothold.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Had my first real chance to look at the 7 in person last weekend (2 actually, a silver and a black).  I still haven't driven, or even been inside, the car, so true evaluation wil have to wait.My impressions on styling alone?  I am wildly ambivalent about this car.  The interior is orders of magnitude better looking than the prior 7, which (unlike the elegant exterior) had become hopelessly dated.  I really like the apparent (deceptive?) simplicity of the design.  The cost paid for that (idrive) may well be too high, but the look is an enormous improvement.  Much nicer, IMHO, than the S or the A8, and on par with the Lexus, although in an entirely different, more extroverted style.Outside, the side aspect is graceful and satisfying, if a bit derivative of the 6, the passat, and a handful of other german sedans.  Nothing new or breathtaking, but certainly no turn off.  (I still don't know what they were thinking with the crease running through the doors, though)  The front of the car -- even with the busy grill/light clusters -- does not bother me in person the way it did in print.  I could certainly learn to live with it (as I have the questionable design of the LexusLS headlights).The rear, as many here have said, is an entirely different matter.  Dark colors, light colors, in person or in a mag, it is just plain ugly.  There are so many ideas and design elements competing for attention that it becomes a jumbled mess.  I have said before, and this in-person inspection confirmed, that it looks as if the rear quarters and trunk were assembled from spare parts from 6 different model years of the same car; all the pieces fit mechanically but don't look as if they came from the same car.  I don't think I would ever get used to that, and would not buy the car for that reason alone (although I suspect that I would not like idrive, and that would probably keep me from buying anyway).My guess is that they are aggressively working as we speak on a facelift for the rear, to bow next year or the year after.  I also guess that they will try to find a way to make idrive an option before too long.  I hope I am right on both (and I hope the car proves reliable), since I would like to be able to consider the car when I am ready to trade out of the LexusLS.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(I still don't know what they were thinking with the crease running through the doors, though)  The front of the car -- even with the busy grill/light clusters -- does not bother me in person the way it did in print.  I could certainly learn to live with it (as I have the questionable design of the LexusLS headlights).The rear, as many here have said, is an entirely different matter.  Dark colors, light colors, in person or in a mag, it is just plain ugly.  There are so many ideas and design elements competing for attention that it becomes a jumbled mess.  I have said before, and this in-person inspection confirmed, that it looks as if the rear quarters and trunk were assembled from spare parts from 6 different model years of the same car; all the pieces fit mechanically but don't look as if they came from the same car.  I don't think I would ever get used to that, and would not buy the car for that reason alone (although I suspect that I would not like idrive, and that would probably keep me from buying anyway).My guess is that they are aggressively working as we speak on a facelift for the rear, to bow next year or the year after.  I also guess that they will try to find a way to make idrive an option before too long.  I hope I am right on both (and I hope the car proves reliable), since I would like to be able to consider the car when I am ready to trade out of the LexusLS.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
                Had to make a trip up to Citizens bank for a morning meeting last Wednesday so I took in the auto show while I was there. Sometimes its nice to be on your own. The family just didn't want to go to the NY show back in May. But the NY show is a far better one.The GS is just a sleek and stunning looking car in person. In pix it looks like an update of the current car. But in the metal it looks like a brand new design a lot closer to the LFS than any picture has ever shown. I can't imagine this car not being an instant and big hit. Can't wait to see the next LexusLS.Ray Catena has knocked down the old dealership on Rt 9 and is now starting to build the new Lexus dealership next to David Michael. I had an interesting situation giving a close friend of mine some tax advice this weekend. This guy is in the process of selling land to Ray as he needs more land in Freehold to store his cars and this guy happens to have ideal space that is central to Edison (MB) and Ocean/Freehold (Lexus/Jaguar) as well as his Infiniti and other dealerships. I can't repeat the things I heard but I can tell you Ray's opinion of Lexus is as top-shelf as it gets. By the way every Lexus dealer is fighting like hell to get as many RX400H suvs as they can get. That thing is going to be white-hot.            ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                of course is that the whole business plan/model put out by VW stinks, even by their lowly standards. VW had problems explaining or justifying this plan to their home base, much less the lucrative US market. The Phaeton is a dud, plain and simple ! At least the Audi had much more upscale brand image with the beautiful A4s and TTs (my daughter wants a TT so badly; its her dream car), A6s, a bevy of S4/S6/S8 and RS8. Despite these, the A8 has been, by lux car standards, a dud in the US market.  So what does VW have to support the Phaeton ? Passats and Jetta's (the BUG is now gone, hopefully permanently)..... I suppose the $25K Passat owner looking to move upscale will look to a, YES, a $66K V8 VW and forgo the likes of Mercedes, Infiniti, BMW, Lexus, Jaguar, Cadillac, etc.. How much is the A6 4.2 Quattro again ? $50K-ish, and a VW is listed at $66K ? Yikes !!!            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Haha!!  Had I not known my wife is a tech-phobe, I would have bet big money your ""Help"" message was from her.Just sold a 2002 Lexus 470. She has a BMW 330 conv. and Im buying a new 'touring' car. So the top 3 were Lexus LexusLS, BMW 745, BenzSClass/500.We love the exterior of the BMW and its ride, we even blindfolded ourselves to overlook the awful rear end design they came up with. It was the I-Drive, however, that was impossible to swallow. Out of the question, especially if you have ever used the systems in a Lexus. As I said, she is a tech-phobe but she took my last Lexus on a 45 minute drive and had it all figured out without lifting the manual. So I took a drive to Lexus and took a look at the LexusLS. I was astonished at the superb job they have done in everything, (styling still a little stodgy but a lot better than it was). AND, for 15k LESS than the BMW. So I was about to write a check to a dealer, and my wife begged me to look at the Benz first. When I saw theSClass/500, I was immediately (and very) emotionally hooked. What a GREAT style with that rake on the front end. It is, imo, the best looking car on the market at any price. However, once I got into looking at the reliability, and in particular the nav/communcations/environmental systems, the Lexus beat it in every single area. (They tie in comfort, the Benz a little stiffer for a sportier ride) I learned my lesson from my BMW what it is like to try and navigate yourself around in the European designed nav, twirling dials and pushing it every few seconds, even for a simple task like changing form FM to AM. And, Benz is traditionally, a couple of generations behind Lexus in tehcnology. E.G., how about Bluetooth technology for Lexus. Outstanding!  Anyway, we've decided to go with the Lexus, and then realized we were also saving about 20k in the process (from the Lexus price I was able to locate). I can throw a heck of a party for that much money. Last week I got the current issue of Consumer Reports...they happened to be comparing these three cars (and Audi). Their findings were almost exactly as our impressions.   Hope this helps. Let me hear what you decide.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"                Yes,  even I the survey detractor have to look at the Audi sideways, only because my own personal observations haven't been good concerning the V8 drivetrain in the A6 4.2 and the previous A8 with the same engine.  They are known for drop their transmission from time to time, especially the A8.  A friend of mine was looking at a 1998 C280 at a Audi dealership, but Audi couldn't sell him the car because the person who traded the C280 in for a 2000 A8 had a trans failure a day after he drove off in the A8.  It seems Audi was giving him static about fixing the trans so he began to raise hell about getting his old car back.  Not sure what the outcome of this was. A 2000 A8 is in my price range, but oh no. That and insurance (aluminum car) would be too much for me.  I wouldn't go near an Audi with ""Audi Certified""  being stamped all over the windshield (lol).  It's a gorgeous car though and if I go ""pre-driven"" as they like to say now, it's my first pick. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                About insurance, yes and no.   For someone around my age, a car like an A8 would be costly to insure anyway, but being constructed of aluminum wouldn't help matters.   Now the target group for cars like the XJ and A8, Donfenn, ljfix and others have those much deeper pockets....No I meant I would buy an A6 4.2 only if was certified. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hands down you will get a better lease deal on the 745i. Why?  Mostly because the relatively low residual on the a8 as compared to the 745i. Other factors to consider include a more comprehensive scheduled maintenance program on the BMW and higher insurance premiums on the Audi( due to its aluminum construction). Intellichoice rates the 7Series as excellent and the a8 as average in terms of cost and reliability.  Even Edmunds has the a8 as having a higher true cost of ownership.From an option standpoint the BMW doesn't have four wheel drive but the A8 is not yet available in a SWB model.Lastly its hard to talk about reliability and get trustworthy info, especially since the a8 is so new.  My personal experience having owned an A6 4.2 and 540i was that the Audi had far more problems but most of them were not serious and were fixed promptly by the dealership.  I recently was in your position and went with the 7Series because the deals were to good to pass up.  So far I love the car.  The whole quirky idrive thing is beyond me... everything seems intelligently if not intuitively designed despite what you read on this page( keep in mind that idrive before '04 may have been a different animal).  IMO MMI is no different.  Good luck with whatever you decide they're both great cars!            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                have i ever called the LexusLS a re badged Celsior?  i don't recall but if i have i would like to see the number of the post because that would be inaccurate.it seems to me that the only way to praise the Lexus LexusLS and the Lexus brand is to attack my own personal purchase.  I've purchased German and Japanese vehicles and i can certainly see through the smoke and mirrors that is marketing.  one thing that i have never been fooled by is the smoke and mirrors of Lexus.  they have 4 and only 4 specific vehicles.  how on this earth an automobile manufacturer could actually be compared to MB with such a minuscule car line is beyond me. Audi maybe...MB never. as for  EClass  taxi cabs....they are stillEClasses aren't they.  they are a trueEClass.  so what's the problem. they could be ""decked out"" if the buyer wanted them that way.  keep in mind they are not re badged in any way.   because they are being used as taxi cabs in some way diminishes them form being a true Mercedes Benz. i don't think so.  talk about reverse snobbery and desperation! oh by the way are ""European taxi cabs"" a brand of automobile?  the  RX  is a Toyota Highlander and vice versa. go across the street and save some money at the Toyota dealer....then you are a true ""thinking man""?  the breadth of the MB lineup whether it be the A class or theSClass....guess what..they are still MB's....not re badged vehicles.  if MB wanted to be like Lexus all they would have to do is re badge a Dodge Durango and they would have a larger suv in their lineup.  well...MB doesn't do things that way.  they have a brand new G class (designed from the ground up) that will be released this fall that will serve as their full sized suv.  and you guessed it...it is a true MB...not re badged with a little wood here and there and the price jacked up. what is the Lexus full size suv?.....a Toyota Land Cruiser masquerading as an LX470.   can you say with 100% certainty that the Celsior is usually equipped to the levels that the LexusLS is in the US? from what i've picked up on other boards it is usually sold in a more spartan form.would the A8 i purchased be diminished as a luxury sports sedan if it had the VW logo?not in practical terms but in business terms..yes it would.  all you have to do is look at the struggle that VW is having selling the Phaeton.  the Phaeton is a beautiful automobile but is left hanging mainly because of brand perception.  as Lexus was once considered an oddball but persiveered...VW will have to do the same.  one difference in the Audi lineup of vehicles in comparison to VW is the use of  high performance engines that are not available in every VW.  the similaritiesof Phaeton and the A8 are the awd and the engine.  after that they are completely different animals. Aluminum vs Steel. the Phaeton weighs about 1000lbs more.  VW and Audi are similar in nature to Lexus and Toyota when it comes to sharing platforms. the main difference that i can see is that from Audi and VW to Lexus and Toyota is this.... the German brands reach much higher with their luxury flagship.  one thing i received when i purchased my A8 was a truly unique vehicle.  the only production sedan made completely  of aluminum.  might not mean anything to you but to me it makes the car special...unique.       hey for 55k the LexusLS is a fine car that is limited in what it offers. at this point in time one fine automobile does notmake a luxury brand...especially compared to MB.           ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                He got the same data I got several weeks ago and it was even deeper in nature. Do I think MB will stand still? I think MB has played its card already. The S65 is far more expensive than this car will be. What's it going to do to answer a car that matches it with later technology, that is green and costs 35% less.Enginneering teams are parcelled out onto different parts of a project. I've had people studying things for me in major projects and acquisitions over the years and they didn't have a clue what the bigger scope and strategy was. It's the way business works. I'll say what I said on the lsboard again here - I think many people are underestimating what Lexus is planning for the 2007 global intro. You have a very successful lux brand established in the US combined with a parent company that has the deepest pockets in the industry (no one is even remotely close) that will become the global car sales leader within 5 years. They have a rapidly developing Scion brand and are way ahead of everyone else on next gen technology. Do you really think they are going to go global with just a basic enhancement of their US strategy given all that clout?? That would fail miserably. As designman said yesterday - they've kept all this stuff pretty quiet and snuck up to this point - but at some point the veil has to come off the secrecy.  BMW - who knows what they will do. I said a long time ago that they are too small for some of these next gen challenges. There are many things they can lead on but not large scale structure changes like the ones coming up in the next 50 years. Either they will get acquired at some point or they will have a major long-term secure alliance if they want to stay indepedent. If this alliance with Toyota over diesels is real maybe they will strike a long-term deal with them. I don't buy for one second the ""Lexus is gunning for BMW"" talk. That's marketing with an intent to change the direction of the perception. But both BMW and Lexus are aiming at hurting MB. It could be ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" situation.

"                Hello!!! I don't know what everyone is sort of arguing about, but my annoying hello was toward Audi. What about the A8 and/or A8L, really? Both are less expensive than most* of their peers, and they have easily the best understated style, the best interiors in their respective class (more 'airy' than a 7Series, because the A8 comes in bright colors and comes with bright wood trim), and frequently win 'Best Large Luxury Sedan' awards. Even edmunds.com has the A8 on the Editor's Most Wanted. I just don't know why no one has mentioned it. It is, basically, the year of Audi, the A6 being the World Car of the Year.

"                Hey maxhonda99,Not a good idea to use the ""M"" sig.  It's potentially confusing on the forum and garyh may end up representing merc as you are in violation of merc's unregistered but widely accepted trademark.    Regarding your post, however, it has long been established that the Lexus advantage is primarily based upon ""value"" as it relates to 1)the price/content ratioand2)reliabilityIf Mercedes and Lexus had the SAME reliability ratings, believe me things would be different.  And even MORE equalizing would be if the prices were equivalent.Just for the sake of isolating those two primary Lexus purchase factors, consider that if a Mercedes SClass and a Lexus lswere the same price with the same reliability, I have little doubt that the Lexus world would be turned upside down.So do not forget what defines the Lexus success story.  It's all about reliability and PRICE (value) and the marketing to back it up.  To even SUGGEST that price is not relevant is ridiculous.  TagMan            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hey you can try as you might, but you can't run around the fact that Lexus fingered BMW as the target, and that means a sports sedan.  All the profit and sales talk won't erase that Lexus said that the 5Series (the standard or former standard as a ""sports sedan"" in the class) was their competition and that on that front it doesn't cut it.  Period.  Who says?  The press has every since it came to market.  You'll notice that in tests where sport wasn't the main criteria, the GS did well, like in the Automobile and Edmunds test, but in test where Sport was more of a factor, like in the Road and Track and C&D reviews it got put behind the real sports sedans in the segment the M45 and 545i (except C&D with tested a puny 530i like boneheads).   I'm sorry if you're not able to understand that a nice nav systems/stereo and isolation aren't what make a sports sedan.   ""Methinks the utlimate competition is in the bottomline, afterall BOTH companies are in the business to make money not just to compete against each other.""That reads like a grand excuse for them not making a sports sedan to challenge the rival they themselves mentioned - BMW.   Every car company is out to make money and pointing this out here means what?   Nothing out of the ordinary. That many on Edmund's prefer the M45 to the GS430 in terms of sporty handling is NOT an indication that the M is a better car than the GS. IMO, the M45 is better in some areas and short in other areas against the new GS. Same can be said in reverse. What matters is what MOST of the buying public prefer, and that, Merc1, will be determined by the sales volume. Let's wait and see the success factor of both cars in the highly competitive mid-size luxury-sport market before we declare which car is the best. You seem to misunderstand me here.  I didn't say that the M45 was just an outright better car than the GS.  I said that the M is a better sports sedan.  There is a difference, that is why I said you can't apply that LexusLS logic to the meduim segment and call the GS some type of standard because it isn't.  So far that would appear to be the M45 as a sports sedan.   Weren't you the one that drove the GS and declared that they missed the mark as a sports sedan or am I making that up?   You asked the others to explain to you on the IS board what a sports sedan is, yet you seem to have forgotten what all of us said already.  As a sports sedan the GS doesn't cut it against the class leaders in the respect.   You ask: ""BTW, what does it mean to be a 5- fighter ?""  Answer: Infiniti M45.  Since you're bent on making excuses for the GS not being a sports sedan like Lexus said they wanted it to be, you'll revert back to ""its selling"" and ""companies are out to make money"".  Come on guy time to really get a new line here. If by chance the IS250/300 don't stack up to the class leaders as a  sports sedan, currently the 3Series and G35, will you say the same thing about the IS too?  I mean Lexus is saying the same thing about the IS as they said about the GS: Target = BMW.  Yet it means nothing to you as long as the car sells and Lexus makes money.  Forget the design brief and/or competition.  Amazing denial. Didn't your guy Clements say that they're staggering engine introductions to be like BMW?  So the GS can be in the press throughout the production cycle?  Their target in the two lower segments is BMW, not Mercedes.  No one said the car is a failure or anything close to it.  It just isn't the sports sedan Lexus promised.  Big difference.   I mean seriously you don't see the difference here.  Read the Automobile compar in which the A6, GS and E placed in that order because they weren't looking for sport as much.  Ditto for Edmunds.  Then look at C&D and Road and Track.  Especially Road and Track.  They state that after a while they knew the real sports sedan battle was going to be between the 545i and the M45, not the GS430. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Granted it is a bit of a jump from a C320 to an LexusLS. I didn't start out comparing a C320 with the LexusLS.  I started out looking for something new to replace my ES300.  After spending several months testing and researching Lexus, BMW, MB, Audi and others I felt the C320 gave me the handling I felt the LexusES lacked but a better interior and features than most others (especially MB) - in short a good compromise for what I was looking for.However after putting my money down I had to wait and wait for delivery.  While waiting I reread the boards (see theCClass board here on Edmunds) and saw all the problems.So I went back to my alternatives.  By then the new ES300 was out.  It was better but still too much like my old LexusES.  The dealer had a new early production 2001 LexusLS that they had priced to sell as the 2002s were arriving.  I had not considered it up until then as I thought it was out of my price range.  However, after driving, and appreciating the car and Lexus quality control even more due to the C320 problems and as the cost was not such a huge jump after the no-haggle price I had settled for on the fully-optioned C320, I bought.

"                GS and IS, even in their best years, could not begin to compare to LexusES and RX sales.  The same can not be said ofEClass.  That's why GS and IS in their waning years was not nearly as significant the decline ofEClass. BTW, the first generation GS300 was quite a different animal from the GS that we know since 1998.LS still outsells 7 and S even in this model wind-down that you are alleging.  Also, isn't proper managing of production and maintain brand/model prestige what a luxury marque maker supposed to do?  Flooding the market with cars that need heavy discount does not jive well with maintaining marque value.IS300 actually did quite well in the first couple model years.  There was no heavy discounting in the first couple model years like what's available on R-class today, within a few short months after introduction.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hi All,   ??Having high end >$100K  cars isn't the sole definition of ""High End"" That's just pure snobbery. Jaguar's XJ Vanden Plas is around 80K these days, yet it is outperformed by LexusLS hands down. It goes to show price isn't commiserate with competitiveness. Of course ""status"" is a big MB attraction..Have you seen their ""Unlike Any Other"" media campaigns lately? They show pictures of people posing next to their cars..It's probably the dumbest thing I've ever seen. If Lexus ever does anything like that I'll sell both of mine and buy a Camry.   ? Even the Autorags consider the lsa worthy competitor to the 7Series,SClass, and A8..The last C/D comparo ranked the lsthe top pick..I think the Motor Trend had it second behind the Audi..The Lexus detractors love to bash the car on marque and driving dyanamics..Last time I checked, marque is more fodder for BS sessions that anything else..In the case of BMW I'd defintely say there is a big difference in dynamics.   ? When I went to the MB dealer to look at SClass cars, I noted the sticker on the  SClass is 90K with all taxes..Granted the  SClass probably has more toys than the LexusLS Ultra but does it deliver 30K more of product? Not at all. I thought the S was a nice car, but the practical aspects of the purchase decision made me buy yet another Lexus..Pure and simple, the Lexus is a thinking (wo)man's car..It'll take that $30K and keep it in the market. Seeing as I only paid 18K for my new one (With trade of my old) it will probably pay for my next two lscars.   ? If you were to do some research, you'll find the ES330 shares 25% of its parts with the Camry. Drive the two and you'll note the difference. The RX came out before the Highlander and definitely bears no physical resemblance to the Highlander. So what if the glass has Toyota written on it? I'm not buying it for the name!   ? Stylewise, I don't think any automaker is producing anything great looking at the moment..The S had a nice profile, but lacks the grand look of the W126..The SClass is an attention getter..But the others are nothing special..Jaguar had it right with the previous XJ, but now only the XK is appealing.   ? At the end of the day, it's the balance sheets that indicate success..Lexus on its' own has been a winner since 1990. Toyota is probably one of the most profitable brands out there..You can't argue with that.   ? SV            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"                Hi All,   I don't care what car you're in, if you hit a concrete beam at 60 MPH there is no way you're walking away from that one. That crash is being investigated in the UK right now as part of some special commission..I think it's a testament to Mercedes engineering that the bodyguard survived that horrific crash. Also, the rear seat passengers were NOT wearing their seatbelts. Mercedes' safety innovations aren't going to help anyone if they're not buckled in!!We all know Mercedes is the class leader in safety (or is it Volvo?) The question posed in this forum is whether a LexusLS would fare as well..There is no hard data to confirm or deny the conclusion that it would or would not. Does Mercedes innovate first when it comes to safety? Yes. Does the addition of an rear side airbag make a car safer than another? Conflicting data on that one. As the small car crash data showed, the cars equipped with them standard did worse than the Corolla optionally equipped with them. The Corolla did fare poorly without the airbags..So there is no clear answer here. It can be assumed all of these cars are built to a very high spec safety wise. You do get what you pay for. I'd feel equally safe in a XJ, LexusLS, 7Series, Phaeton, A8, orSClass. They're all built like tanks. It'd be interesting for someone to crash all these cars (Quite expensive too) and find out if anyone stands out from the rest. My guess is that they'll all do comparably well. Much like that small car comparo no one would really stand out. I was expecting the Volkswagen New Beetle to win that crash test. I've been in one a few times and it feels solid. It was surprising that the Corolla did the best..I've always regarded the Corolla as a tin can. As tiag_m5 pointed out my postulation about ""plastic"" cars not being as safe is in fact false.

"                Hi All,   I just tried out the BEST leather treatment ever. It's called Leatherique and is a two step process. Since my 92 is at the dealer I decided to try it on my new 05 LexusLS. You wouldn't believe how soft the leather is now! On the downside, it is rather expensive ($55 for Two bottles Conditioner and Cleaner) and requires a warm day to have a full effect. I put a space heater inside of it and was very pleased with the results. It's even better than when I bought it in December. It is apparently used in Museums to keep the leather soft and supple.  I've been trying to find a way to preserve the leather on my new car, especially after how badly my leather seats in my 92 have aged. (Much of that is my fault, since I didn't know how to maintain a leather interior) I'm having the 92's seats redyed, but I'll try this treatment on it when I get it back. ljflx,  So your wife likes the IS? Perhaps an opportunity to steal your lsback? I tried to bait my wife into taking my new Corolla. Strange enough, it actually worked! I think she just takes whatever is new. I think she's doing it to show me she can get away with it! Hopefully she won't take the 92 once I get it back. One word about the Corolla, not the most comfortable car in the world, but 33 MPG..It cost only $28 to fill it, and I got 330 miles out of it. I was impressed with the fit and finish of the cabin. The tolerances look good enough for a Lexus let alone an economy car. SV            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hi all,   I see the same comments about MB being made once again. MB is here to stay pure and simple on the grounds of brand strength alone. They could rebadge Yugos as MB's and people will still buy them. Here's an example: Under the ownership of British Leyland, Jaguar's quality control was horrendous..But people still bought them. Jaguar owners were quite loyal for many of the same reasons most Euro owners are. I was somewhat disappointed by the newSClass. I didn't think MB needed to copy the 7Series. They already had a great interior design. The outside isn't as exciting as the current car, but it does look nice in that Dark Maroon picture Merc posted aways back. If their quality is up to par I'll definitely have a look. The CLS is an interesting looking car, but the headlight treatment could have been better. The lssketches look okay. I certainly won't be rushing to trade in my LexusLS for that. Come to think of it, I'm not really impressed by anything that is in the pipeline. The sole interesting looking car is the Audi A8. I actually did see a Maybach in Boston the other day. I wasn't terribly impressed. I'd much rather have a MBSClass. The S has a cleaner classier look to it. Makes me sort of regret passing on theSClass. The current S is a handsome car. Anyone know how the SClass is faring in reliability these days?SV            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"                hi again,  ? a couple of points.  the LexusLS is no way comparable to theSClass.  The SClass haSClassHP!...the LS290?  also the SClass is only available in the US in the Long version.  when it comes to age between the two...the SClass has not had one change to the exterior sheet metal.  the lshad the entire front end massaged to be more appealing.  that is what i based my age comment on.     ? as for the Camry and the LexusES...they are basically the same car.  same engine, platform and transmission.  sure they nice up the LexusES a bit but in the end it is a well optioned Camry....and there is nothing wrong with that ...the Camry is a fine automobile.  for this discussion though it brings about the point that Lexus is still a young brand that fills its showrooms with re badged Toyota's.  regardless which vehicle came first the RX or the Highlander...what's the difference they are both one and the same.  Lexus's lion share of sales are from the RX and the LexusES.  both of which are basically Toyota's. again not a bad thing but is this a luxury brand?  ? when i view luxury brands Lexus is in my mind more equal to Infiniti and Acura while MB, BMW, and Audi sit on a higher level. part of this is the fact that the German brands push their flagships to much higher levels than the Japanese.  more HP, luxury, and intriguing design.  ? calling the Lexus ""the thinking mans car"" is stereotyping.  are you saying that people who purchase Mercedes Benz's ...don't think?   ? for some reason i have never identified myself with an automobile to the point that i would feel better about myself if the companies balance sheet looked good.  i either like the car or i don't!   ? here is a link to an article that reflects the  SClasses dominance in the luxury segment.  ? http://www.germancarfans.com/news.cfm/newsid/2041117.007/mercedes- - /1.html ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hi All,   ??There is such a segment for those cars ""Entry Level Luxury"" You pointed out that the LexusES shares the frame, engine and transmission with the Camry..Does that consititute 100% of the car? It does sound more like 25%..I've driven both cars and know the difference between the two..The defect rate of an LexusES is much lower than that of a Camry. Keep in mind the LexusES is assembled solely in Japan whilst a big chunk of Camry's are made in Kentucky.   ? As far as quality..I just drove aSClass..There was a great deal of plastic in that car..Hardly befitting for a 77K sedan. The interior was nothing special..The lshas better wood accents and softer leather..The Ultra is even better than my car..My 1992 LexusLS has been trouble free to this date..I don't think the Euro cars can match that kind of reliability.   ? Not all cars are built equally..Have a look at JDP and see where those German marques rank..It's sad when Jaguar is the highest ranked nameplate..I don't buy cars on a whim. I actually do ""Really like"" my Lexus' cars. I don't have the time or patience to deal with any quirks..Had I, a Jaguar would have been in my garage a long time ago. Hence my label of Lexus as a ""Thinking Man's Car""  ? SV            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hi All,   ??You still ignore the fact that the LexusES by parts content shares 25% commonality with a Camry. That does not make it the same car!! Try and back up your opinions with facts for a change.   ? I don't know where you get your info from, but the RX in no way is a Highlander. The RX debuted in 1998. Highlander came along a few years later. I don't see the resemblace sorry..The RX is at least twice the price of a Highlander..I've been in both and there isn't anything identical.   ? Even the autorags disagree with your assessment of Lexus..Why is it that they rank the lshigher than most of those brands? In the last C/D comparo, the lswon..It came in second to the Audi in another. If your ""opinion"" was correct, why do diehard performance fans like C/D put the lsagainst these cars in the same place?    ? What higher levels are you talking about? Electronics that don't work? Complicated interfaces that befuddle even Car and Driver? Seven Speed transimissions that have a 4% improvement on Fuel Economy? (Mind you even 911's don't have that!)   ? Have you noticed the correlation of the introduction of these systems with reduced reliability? JD Power has ranked Lexus No 1 for seven years running! The hybrid technology is more of a innovation than iDrive will ever be. Having just been through the car shopping experience, the Lexus had everything MB, Audi, and BMW did (and more), save the iDrive nonsense. Luxury? You obviously have never been in a LexusLS..It's cabin trumps anything save a Jaguar Vandenplas.   ? Design? What's so great about BMW's Bangle design? Audi is okay, and MB is nothing special.. Jaguar rightly holds the award for that...The only advantage a German car has over Lexus is Handling ability. (BMW) I don't see anything special about an Audi or MB...From my perspective, the 15K premium I was about to pay on the SClass was merely for the MB prestige and the 4 Matic.   ? I think calling the Lexus a ""thinking man's car"" is a fair label..Lexus owners look at the Objective statistics and make their decision. We examine things such as reliability, depreciation, safety, customer service surveys, etc to evalute our purchase..To a Lexus owner our time is money, we don't have the patience to deal with gimmicks laden cars nor do we relish the idea of dealing with arrogant dealers and suspect cars. Mind you a fair number of Lexus owners are former MB owners. Ever wonder why they switched?  ? SV            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
                Don't like it at all. Seems to cheapen the look of the car. The 2004 A8 front and grille is spectacular. But the next gen seems to blow it. With that said though the overall look of the next A6 looks pretty good.merc1 - C&D said the V12 big Audi would be $138k in Europe. Seems far too high. What's does an SClass go for in Europe?            ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hi All,   Is it me, or do all of these cars just get uglier as time goes on? At this point, I haven't a compelling reason to get any one of these! I was disappointed with the new S. The current one is a stunning looking car. If I had more confidence in the quality of the current S, I might just get one of those instead. Is it wise to think the end run of the current S will be better than those of the past? I'm hoping the new LS460 is a vast improvement of the prior exterior design. The current design that I have is okay, not ugly, but not especially exciting to look at either. Lexus has been capable in times past of producing a sharp looking car. The original SCand LexusES are indications of this. Another disturbing trend: The rush to cram all sorts of useless electronics in these cars. I wonder if there is a direct correlation with all this content and falling reliability. These toys virtually guarantee that you'll be forced to trade the car before the warranty ends. That's why I've resorted to trading my LS's in on a three yr cycle, as expensive as it is depreciation wise. Perhaps I'm in the minority, in the sense I look to keep this cars for > 5 yrs. Maybe the automakers are catering to those who trade on a 3 yr basis like most here appear to do. Give me a Mercedes or Lexus without an air suspension, NAV, pointless Keyless Go systems, and all this electronic nonsense so I can concentrate on the driving!!SV            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hi All,   It's funny to see the same things being discussed again. Despite Mercedes' problems, it still has a mystique that no other car maker has yet, save Rolls Royce. The MB is still something people aspire to and a brand that evokes an emotional response from its followers. I think their designs have only become attractive in the past few years. The outgoing SClass is a stunner, especially in the darker colors. Why did they have to mess around with such a nice design??  It's something Lexus needs to improve on. I am no fan of any Lexus car at the moment. The GS doesn't do it for me, and it seems pointless to put such an intruding Traction control system in a car designed to take on the 5Series. Why not put an ""off"" button? I hope the same mistake is not made with the IS. Lexus cars normally sell well in the first 18 months, but then start to fade. I think it's still too early to call it a victory for Camp Lexus. The only reason I stay with the lscars is simply because of the competition's quality issues at the moment. I'd like to see Lexus come out with the sort of designs that put them on the map in the first place like the original LexusLS, LexusES, and SC. These were interesting cars that actually stirred some excitement in me. Let's see what Lexus does next..SV            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hi All,  I'm starting to wonder whether it's time to let my 92 lsgo and replace it with an ES330. Lexus and Jaguar has some good lease rates right now and I don't know whether I should take advantage of it...Having put $2K into it I know I sound like a fool..But those were safety issues, and it would be unethical to sell a car in that state...My question is, should I just cut my losses? Or am I just making something out of nothing? It has 96,000 miles and I've replaced rear shocks, Right Front Upper Control Arms, Rear Carrier Bushings, Power Steering Pump and Rack. Also, I've done the standard 90K where the Timing Belt and Water Pump.  But the issues is this..It needs two new sets of tires (Summer and Snow) Front brakes sooner or later, and I worry the alternator will quit one of these days. Counting the 2K I've already spent, it is almost breakeven when comparing it to leasing a ES330 or getting an 3 yr old XJ..Your thoughts?SV            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hi All,  Sorry about that last post. I tried to edit it, but the Video banner is blocking the Edit button. Here is a link to a picture of the current EShttp://www.lexus.com/models/es/gallery_interior_photos.htmlI agree Mercedes has many issues, but I'm worried Lexus is starting to develop the arrogant attitude that got MB into trouble in the first place. My experiences with Lexus Corporate and Dealer Management seem to indicate this. I understand I may be the exception to the Rule, but I'm sure I'm not alone here. I still feel the original LexusLS personified what a Lexus should be. Every lscar after it has been a big letdown for me. The LS460 was supposed to be 1989 all over again, but I don't see it. It's a nice car filled with all sorts of electronics, but it doesn't have that same flair. -Sam            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hi all, ???I think all this talk of MB's demise is being overstated. It simply appears Mercedes is having some issues of late. Given their long history, I'm sure they'll be able to recover. A company like MB won't just cease to be a competitor. Cars like the SL500 indicate that they are still very capable of producing an unbeatable world class car. ????I've said this many times: I see a trend in the luxury carmakers to cram their cars full of electronics. Is there really any purpose for parking radar and all these other useless gimmicks? Like anything, the more complicated the design, the more problems you are going to face. I think Jaguar has done the best job of making sure the new age toys aren't too intrusive. I'd pit Lexus second, only b/c I have to switch on the Touchscreen to access my climate control settings. Being greeted with ""The Lexus Link System is Active"" every morning in my LexusLS is driving me nuts. Maybe I'm too much of a purist, but I really think this electronics rage is going too far. As for the MB vs Lexus debate. We've all argued to no end that Lexus builds a superb car. The only legitimate complaint that the MB camp may have is the insipid designs they've been turning out as of late. I was given a brand new ES330 for a loaner..Fantastic car inside, and drove beautifully. But the exterior design provokes nothing more than a Yawn. There is absolutely nothing engaging about it whatsoever. I'm anxious to see the what the 2006 lslooks like. If it's another SClass clone, I'll be terribly disappointed. SV            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hi All,  ?I think MB does have a reliability problem at this point..And I'm sure they're working on it..If cars like the new SLK are representative of MB's future then I think they'll be fine. But they do have to revise their business model. It doesn't matter how broad their lineup is, it's the financials that matter..MB as of yet hasn't produced solid numbers.   ?Lexus has more than 3 ""Lexus specific cars"" The LexusES only has 25% commonality with a Camry..It's called Platform Sharing..That's like me calling anEClass a 300C..The RX is also a ""pure"" Lexus..The GS is an old car and the SCis a niche product at best..They shouldn't have messed up the last gen SC.. ?Jaguar doesn't do anything that you have classified as ""upscale"" yet they are considered an upper class marque..I don't see what's so upscale about the SLK and CLK..If you meant to say the SClass and CL then I'd agree with you..We all know Price does not equal Quality in any respect... ?I've always maintained that Lexus is for the informed consumer, not one who wishes to engage in bull sessions about how expensive their car is..Case in point: Bill Gates is a known owner of ls/430's..As the richest man in the world, he could care less about status.  ?As long as my car holds its value well, drives well past 10 yrs, and the customer service is good, I'll remain a Lexus customer. I did consider a MB but the dealership experience and reliability concerns were enough to dissuade me..Perhaps your experience has been fine, but JDP surveys have a much wider sample.  ?SV            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hi All, ??Back to the topic I posed...Should the auto manufacturers continue to cram all these electronics into cars? I somehow don't see my LexusLS holding up as wel as my original LexusLS has over 12 years..There are simply too many electronic gimmicks in the car. Perhaps I'm wrong, but it seems like these cars are not being designed to be trouble free as the old MB's and original lscars.?You're all going to call me crazy, but Lexus owners, sit in an original lsand then in a new one..You'll notice the switches are lesser quality, and the car doesn't exude the solidness that the original did. The numbers even tell the tale. In 1990, it was estimated the car cost around $42-45K to manufacture. (Leading MB to charge Toyota was dumping the vehicles in the US market) Two years back when I bought my 430 the invoice price was around 50K. Maybe this is why I probably won't keep the car beyond it's warranty which expires next September. I firmly believe what some have posted here: Automakers should offer simpler versions of their cars. What do you all think?SV            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hi All, ??I think the GT has a refreshing look. It's definitely unique. That sort of underscores what is routinely discussed here. Each manufacturer needs to have it's own look. I am not terribly impressed with the latest offerings from MB, BMW, Lexus, and Jaguar. Here are my gripes:1) BMW= I think Bangle says it all..It looks like something out of a Taiwanese cartoon..The Z4 and 745 just look too bloated2) MB= For $90K You think they could design a rear end that doesn't look like it was stolen from a Honda. The low profile of the car, however, is great. The interior design is pretty good, but you'd think it would be more luxuorious for the $$$.3) Lexus= Competely insipid designs here. The  RX  gives me some hope for the future. I wish they'd made the LexusLS with those new headlights from the beginning. It adds a bit of spice to an otherwise dull design. I wasn't going to trade in my '02 though for just that. The Interior is like a palace, but it isn't as sleek as the Original LexusLS. The dash seems abit bulky to me. 4) Jaguar=Ahh! Why did they mess with Perfection? The new XJ looks too much like the X type. The lines of the new car seem less well defined. The rear of the car is just disappointing. It lacks the flair of the previous model. At least it retains the 1st class interior. Any one want to agree/disagree with the above?SV            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hi All, ??I'll just add my two cents to the discussion..I'd agree with Merc that MB and BMW are not in serious trouble. I'll qualify that with a ""Yet"" however. You can't ignore the bad press both automakers are having right now. Reliability is still a major part of the decision making process. IF left unaddressed, this is going to start to hurt their bottom line. Anyone have profit/loss data on Toyota, DCX, and BMW? You could say what Reliability to is MB, Styling to Lexus. It's a problem no doubt. Merc is correct in his assessment of the Lexus product line. The GS, SC, IS, and LX are older designs. The latest generation of Lexus designs are encouraging however. I like the streamlined look of both the new lsand RX. The GS concept still does nothing for me..It's highly subjective isn't it? I'd like to see Lexus develop an AMG style line, no more of this half hearted L-Tuned nonsense. The Company has been around since 1990, so they've had long enough to get their act together. Also, they ought to turn the SCback into a real sports car, not some retiree cruiser. Ditto for the IS and GS lines. A sidebar..Which of these cars have the best exhaust system? As a big fan of V-8 engines, I always enjoy a satisfying roar with the turn of the key..The LexusLS disappoints in this respect, the old 92 lsI have makes more of a roar when started..SV            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hi all, ??We all need to keep in mind how young Lexus is. 14 yrs is pretty young for a car company. ?For all those Auto Historians..How long did it take for MB to carve it's niche out in the industry? From the beginning Lexus has played it safe. As a young upstart they simply took what the Best (MB) was doing and attempted to improve on it. If you remember their Marketing in 1989-90, you'll recognize the textbook job. Infiniti took a different route and got poor results. (Even though the Q was a fantastic cars.) Sometimes it's how you present things. Lexus' prime Marketing tool is the Reliability coupled with Service and High end electronics. They definitely do follow MB's lead in deciding what options belong in cars. Given their young age, it's hard to blame them for that...BUT, I think we're going to see Lexus start to establish themselves as something other than a Benz imitator. Models such as the  RX  (Hybrid) and Future GS are indications of this. Now that Toyota has really given Lexus their own identity, I hope it will translate into a distinctive Brand Identity. I'd love for them to embrace their initial designs of the lsand SCand apply them to the future designs. This upcoming Hybrid launch may indicate Lexus' niche will be in technology. Time will tell.SV            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hi All, I think Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The person who spoke of the Golden Age is the Head Mechanic at my Lexus dealer. Other mechanics have made the same comment.You can argue that there is nicer leather and what not in the 1995+ models and I'll have to agree with you. Mind you the 1995 was very similar to the 1994 mechanically. It had the same 4 spd Automatic and 1uz-FE engine in it. It was just a 10 HP increase. The interior was completly different however. The exterior was a clear derivative of the original. Next time ask your Service Writer what he/she thinks about the quality of the early ones compared to now. Did you ever see any recalls for fuel pumps and transmissions on the old one? Did you see any problems with the display cluster like they had in the 1998 model? How about the jerky accelerator? They had a single recall for the Cruise Control in the 1990 model. The question here is absolute quality. Look at the side mirrors for example. They are much thicker on the old car. Feel the dimmer on your new car. Then go feel the dimmer on a 1990 LexusLS. Then feel the door handle. The 1990-94 had a much thicker handle. Check the grille next, and then the window switches. Everything is thicker plastic or chrome.  You'll notice the difference, but I appreciate it is hard to realize this unless both cars are sitting next to each other. My 1992 sits next to the 2005 so it's easy for me to make the comparison. I will be the first one to say that my experience is NOT the norm. Maybe it is just the MA dealers. Of course. I've never been out of state for Lexus service. In dispute resolution with Lexus HQ I've found that they always offer the same excuses and apologies. It takes legal action to force action on their part. Like I said, Lexus still makes a great car. This is an undisputable fact. They are technically advanced as they come, and they're starting to establish themselves as an innovator. I see only good things happening to them in the next few years. As a long time owner I've really been let down by their customer service. I would have bought the LS460 without hesitation had I not had such a bitter experience with Lexus HQ and Dealership over the maintenance of my 92 LexusLS. In fact, the goodwill of the 1992 experience kept me a Lexus buyer, even though I liked the SClass more. By Probability it is unlikely the SClass will be as reliable as the lscars. It is also true that it will not hold value as well nor will it have Bluetooth, Backup Camera, and Parking Radar. I've always maintained that Lexus appeals to the objective buyer. What does the SClass offer then? Many Safety features standard, a timeless graceful design, Airmatic (Hope that doesn't cause more problems than it solves), 4 Matic (Big one for me), and enough toys to keep me occupied. Of course I didn't have to pay for it, so that's a plus! In addition maintenance is paid for over 3 yrs. I fully expect this car to be more problematic. That isn't the issue. The MB dealer really treated me like royalty. That was the clincher. This doesn't mean I'll cease being a Lexus fan. The 92 lshas created enough goodwill that I'll always defend them!However, I won't be so quick to slam Mercedes unless this SClass falls apart of breaks down somewhere!-Sam            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hi All, I think the branding issue is just part of the maturation process of Lexus. They were smart enough to realize that no one was going to shell out $50K+ in the US for a Toyota. We all can look at VW's Phaeton as an example of what not to do. (Incidentially I hear this car sells well in Europe)Of course, when you pay that much $$$ for a car, there is a certain snob factor to it all. I'm surprised it took Toyota this long to give Lexus their own brand identity in Japan. It doesn't help the prestige argument when MB fans point to the fact that the lsis sold as the Toyota Celsior in Japan. As I've discussed in my last point, it's just part of the growing process.Tasillo, The MB crowd knocks Lexus for copying styling cues from MB models and stealing certain options. I'm assuming they want Lexus to have their own identity rather than borrow from others..I've always felt the first lswas the best..The next models got blander and blander. When I look at my LexusLS, I do see a strong resemblance to the oldSClass. It's annoying. Lexus has shown us that they can build unique looking cars with the RX, old SC, and GS. However, the future of Lexus looks good with the HPX. That's once nice looking car..As for stealing options from MB, it's just smart business. (Although bad for prestige discussions like this) The Japanese are known for mimicing others. They take apart someone else's invention and simply make it better. Sony did this with TV's and chased the American companies out of business. To me, it really doesn't matter who invented it, but who makes the best product. But I suppose when the discussion involves high priced luxury cars, things aren't so clear cut.SV            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hi all, Shoddy engineering? Funny, I've never heard Lexus being accused of that..We all know Japanese electronics are second to none..I only bring up profits to show that Lexus is successful where it counts. You keep missing the point: Prestige is nice, but it doesn't pay the bills..Profits do!! Hardly ramblings...You still haven't addressed the fact: How is it that Lexus sells for LESS and still makes more profit on the LexusLS vs MB on theSClass..Merc is correct to say that MOST consumers of these cars probably don't consider profits..But I doubt they also care who was first to market the airbag or whatever. "" What about the fact that Lexus is perhaps the least safety conscious high end brand as shown by their inability to innovate? What about those facts?""What facts? Least safety conscious? If so, they would do poorly in ALL safety tests. I looked at those links for the crash results..You pretty much confirmed what I thought..The lsgot the highest rating and in fact was recommended for frontal collisions!!!! The RX and GS were marked down to Average in one category..This is hardly a basis to judge a car ""unsafe"" or ""Shoddy engineering.."" I noted your link on the rear crash performance. You may have a point there, but here's what they say:""For each seat/head restraint, rear-end crash protection is an assessment of occupant protection against neck injury in rear impacts at low to moderate speeds. Although such injuries usually aren't serious, they occur frequently""So basically 90% of the time the lswill hold up as well as the competitors. (In the frontal types of crashes) In the 10% where it may not perform as well the injuries usually aren't serious to begin with...This sounds like a marginal advantage at best...Why don't you list the countless times Toyota has had bad crash results, and I'll counter with 15 years of JDP superiority and stories of your beloved German marques breaking down. I think we're even there. Why is it that a 1996 LexusLS is more reliable than a 2002 7Series..Now exactly how SAFE is a MB when the Airmatic Suspension quits on you? You're of course going to say this occurs hardly 10% of the time..But so is the case where the MB will outperform the LexusLS..Now how is it unfair that the SClass is compared to the LS? Using your logic, the SClass should be a fair comparison because it is priced higher. Yet the LexusLS still beat it anyway. Someone already pointed out they didn't test the Euro Sport model. I read that comparo recently and said it was like comparing a person on slippery ballerina shoes to normal ones..Even THEY admit it wasn't fair..So what are you going to argue now???You seem to say best value doesn't mean ""best"" overall..According to the recent Road and Track, Car and Driver, JDP, CR, and Resale Values, High price doesn't mean BEST either....You still don't explain why Lexus makes more Profit off the LexusLS than MB makes off a SClass DESPITE being 15K less!!! You subscribe to the foolish notion that Pricier means better...Did you know a $15 Timex is more reliable and accurate than a 15K Rolex???Sounds like the high price of the S is due to inefficiency more than price premium..Here's where profits are important: Less profit, less R&D..As far as I've seen it, Toyota has taken on R&D projects where it can profit immensely from. You're completely ignoring the whole business side to this.Actually Boeing and Airbus differ big time on design. Fly by Wire vs Mechanical Controls is a HUGE issue in the aviation world. (Air Force 1 does not have Fly by Wire, despite it being available at the time) British Airways has insisted the 747 Advanced NOT have Fly by wire. The 747 has triple redunancy on all critical systems whereas the A340 has two. The 747 does have more innovative safety features than the A340, yet this has not stopped airlines from buying the Airbus..You should stop and think whether any corporation is going to open themselves up to lawsuits from a product that is ""unsafe"" or ""poorly engineered""Given that Lexus commands a high customer loyalty I doubt they'd risk their business by building cars that are unsafe. If they can spend $4 Billion on the original LexusLS do you think they'd skimp on $500 electronics?? They've chose to spend their R&D on Award Winning Customer Service, NAV's, Hybrids, superior reliability, and cutting edge electronics whilst building a car that is STILL recommended by the NHTSA and various other agencies for safety..            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hi Everyone,    I've spoken to many Lexus mechanics who feel the same exact way I do about these cars. Look at the window switches for example, and even the cluster dimmer switch. On the original LexusLS the plastic was much thicker in these places. The Steering Column had a switch to turn off the auto retract as well. The side mirrors on the 92 lsare much thicker than the ones on the later cars. The wiper and turning signal stalks had a much better feel on them in the original car. It just feels cheap on the new lscars. Everything on my 1992 lshas this ""Built to last forever feel"" I'm not saying a new lswill fall apart, but isn't built to that standard. The design of the original lsstill looks good today. Mercedes derivative or not, it still has a classic look to it. The interior cluster has a far more sleeker design to it than my new ls's. While functional, the new ls's dashboard design is clunky. The old LexusLS has a much sleeker design to it. Lexus used to build some timeless classics, such as the original LexusLS, SC400, and even ES300. I don't see that anymore. My LexusLS already has this ""old"" look to it, whereas carmakers such as Audi have cars that will always look good. People still think my '92 LexusLS is a new car. They think I'm lying when I tell them it's 14 yrs old. My 1992 lssits right next to my 2005 LexusLS, so it's easy for me to make the comparisons. Most of the posters here trade every few years. I like to keep my cars beyond 5+ yrs. I firmly believe that the 2005 will not hold up as well as the 1992 has. In my '02 I had to replace the rain sensor three times, and replace the steering column all under warranty. The 1998 CPO used to stall and the cluster would blink intermittently. I agree with all your comments about the extended warranty. I'll definitely get one should I choose to keep it beyond the 4 yr 50K warranty. I think this is true for any HELM. Do I think the SClass will be as reliable as my Lexus? No. As long as it isn't a lemon, I think the experience will be worth it. What really put me off about Lexus is their customer service. My experience with their Service Dept has been horrendous. Never in my life, have I had to micromanage the Service of my car, especially when I'm paying $100/hr!My Mercedes Dealer is Chambers Motorcars of Somerville, MA. They have done a fantastic job so far. I can't comment on their Service Department, but I will in time.-Sam            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hi All,  ?Since when does variety of engines and wheelbases apply to the prestige argument? As someone rightly pointed out, that would mean a Ford Focus is more prestigious than a Rolls Royce.  ?Lexus has a few models that are considered Luxury cars, LexusLS, SC, GS..I'd call the LexusES an entry level Lux sedan..I think prestige is formed by high quality, driving experience, customer service, and of course Public Perception. As far as engine options go, Lexus is going that route you prescribed in 2007. You've also refered to price as another criteria.. ?Did it ever occur to you that most of those models are vastly overpriced? I don't see how Jaguar can charge $80K (VDP?) for a car that isn't very competitive..Same goes for theSClass..At $78K I found it somewhat lacking in terms of equipment. The Mercedes dealer I went to freely admitted that they couldn't compete with Lexus on price..He was trying to steer me towards the subjective argument of ""feel and prestige..""  ?You only seem to hear German car enthusiasts putting down Lexus as a second rate marque. No one can deny the Original LexusLS changed the whole industry. Sure it doesn't have the 100 yr tradition of the others, but it's success more than justifies it being a player in this market. Btw, does anyone know when each marque was established? I know MB is the oldest but don't know much about the other brands.  ?As far as Gizmo's go, you can argue the Germans have gone a step further with all this iDrive interface nonsense. Lexus adds electronics without them being too intrusive and they work flawlessly.The sole exception is this drive by wire nonsense..(What was the point of that?) Do I really need a computer to push the gas pedal??  ?A more general comment..All these electronic toys are great...But what happens when they decide to stop working? The more complicated you make it, the more likely it's going to have issues..I still don't think I should have to use my touchscreen to access basic A/C and radio controls...Doesn't Audi or Infinti have a pop-up NAV screen with separate controls for everything else..I can only imagine when this thing breaks in 8-10 yrs what it's going to cost me to fix it.  ?SV            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hi Everyone,   Thanks for your comments. I came to the same conclusion regarding the deal. I hate selling my own cars, it's such a hassle. However, there is another Mercedes dealer here who is part of the same chain that owns the Lexus dealer I bought mine from.   I think it makes more sense to buy a new '06 SClass and trade mine in. Normally this chain of dealers will give you full Kelley trade in, which is around 50K in my case. I'll see what it all comes to. I like the car, but like everyone on this board, I'm going to be smart about it.Having said all of that, it's a nice car. The reason I want one is the 4-Matic feature and of course the styling. Owning a Mercedes has been a lifetime ambition, but I've never had the nerve to buy one. It is alot of money especially when compared to the LexusLS..But it is a nice car, that's for sure. It's one of those things that isn't easily explained. If we were all ""rational"" people we'd all be driving Toyota Camrys. My son wanted to buy me the car as a birthday present. I had no idea he's been saving every penny for the last few months to do it. That would explain why he hasn't bought himself an older XJ yet. Like me, my son is a car guy. (Much to his mother's annoyance!) I wasn't even thinking of buying a new car. He just told me yesterday about his plans. I don't want him spending all of his money on this car (He's only 23) so I'll likely pitch most of it in, that is if he'll let me! Thanks for your comments, Sam            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                hi everyone, in reference to the updates of theSClass. MB didn't change any sheet metal.  when the lswas updated the hood and front fenders were changed.  essentially the SClass has on the exterior remained unchanged.  ?why do people who purchase a Lexus need MB,Audi,BMW to fail in order to feel validated in their purchase?

"                Hi everyone! I'm new to the luxury car board. I recently got an Audi A6 in February. Since then, I've already put close to 11,000 miles on it. I really like the way it drives--comfortable, fast enough for me, like the way it looks, and feels safe with the quattro. I've owned three BMW's before I finally got the Audi (a friend advised me to get one). Though I did research on it and  found out that it had many, many bad reviews on the Audi board, I went ahead and purchased it after seeing it in person.The three BMW's that I owned (I still have a 2000 model), all have had numerous problems with them. The first was a '94 525i. I spent an extra $11,000 on the car fixing it after the car overheated and killed the engine. Plus, the glass fog lights kept breaking every few months whenever a small rock hit it. The second was a '00 323Ci. I had to replace the speakers, amplifier, wood trimmings, instrument cluster, outside temperature gauge and door moldings (twice). The 2000 328Ci that my wife drives has had the VANOS intake system, wood trimmings, and door moldings (twice also) replaced. The only reason I haven't traded it in is because my wife likes the way it looks and likes to drive cars until it is at least five years old. A BMW specialist told me recently that BMW's are not made to be owned more than 60,000 miles. They are sprinters; not marathon cars like Japanese vehicles.I've been following the news about the 2004 Audi A8 L every since I first saw it at Autoweek.com. It's the best luxury sedan I have ever seen. I even sent AudiUsa.com an e-mail telling them how in love I was with it when I saw it. I wish that I could afford one, but not in this economy right now. Maybe someday.For those of you who don't like Japanese luxury cars, I tell you this--no car, in general, will last as long and as easy to maintain as the Japanese brands. Many of my relatives and friends own them, and they all have never had any complaints about them. They may not look as good or drive as nice as the Germans, but they are fine cars if you intend to keep them for several years.If there are any owners out there who like or dislike their luxury cars, please post on this board or e-mail me at dwongswong@yahoo.com telling me the likes and dislike about these fine cars. I want to know so that I can have an idea about what luxury car I want to get next. Also, if there is anyone who just got the 2004 A8, please let me know about your experience.Thank you! And as always, drive safely out there.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hi All,  ?Styling is pretty bland across the whole segment..I nearly bought anSClass, but it wasn't for looks either..I don't find the Phaeton or A8 anything special lookswise..The only car I that I thought was a head turner was the previous generation XJ..The new one lacks the flair of the previous car..That said, the new XJ is alot more practical in regard to headroom. I'll be the first to admit my new LexusLS is bland, but then again there really isn't anything out there that's especially good.. ?I think the best looking cars where the mid 80's MB SClass and SL..The Early Lexus LexusLS,SC, and LexusES are a close second. There is a dealer in MA (Hatch & Sons) that sells very low mileage late model Mercedes cars..Next time, instead of buying new, I might picked up a late 80's SL..It still looks good today.What a classy design! ?SV            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So much pics from Merc1 in an attempt to stage-manage this forum to his interests.... Well, here is my response: The CLS is tame in design, the low roofline will give some poor shmuck a headache trying to get in without looking. The rear is just terrible as well. Who are they trying to sell this car to ? A bunch of 30-something ? Don't think it will sell well at all, imo.BTW, the BMW designs pre-Bangle (3, 5) are, IMO, the best looking cars on the road today. Period. Far more timeless than the wanna-be slick new MB designs post MY1999. Prior MBs are, of course, very spartan, uglified edifices, but very solidly built with high quality materials, and excellent safety gadgets. The electronics work as designed too. Can't say the same for today's MBs. Poor build quality, unreliable electronics, and un-MB-like poor grade on reliability. What's Schrempf smoking these days ?Did I mention the lsyet ? Nope...

"                How are you doing buddy?I didn't like the GS in pix either but it's very different in person. Lenscap pointed that out many times and now I know exactly what he means.I don't have anything really new on the LexusLS. I may meet Catena personally because of this transaction and if I do I will certainly ask. My gut tells me the lsis a 2007 (though Consumers still says 2006) but enters the market in March/April 2006 rather than September. I think the powerful hybrids (V12 equivs)come after Sept. 2007 but a significantly more powerful V8 hybrid (say 400HP) hits before that, maybe from day one of the new LexusLS. I also think the HPX is inevitable and probably hits in 2007. But from what the people at Catena told me they want it as part of the worldwide launching and they also didn't want to crowd the RX400H launching. That RX400H will be more than $50K by the way.GS - I don't think you will see any more powerful gas engines from Lexus. Lexus/Toyota is completely going for power via the hybrids. That's why they never joined the HP wars. I think these hybrids will leave a lot of people in the dust real quickly - on the road and in sales. Did you see that the Accord hybrid makes 0-60 in 6.5 seconds? You'd have to be nuts to waste money on old technology C-class cars in the next few years against what's coming from Acura and Lexus given that stat, new, cleaner and better technology, increased performance and sky high reliability. I don't know how MB is going to hold up its price points. They better have something more than they've shown up their sleeves. Plus the Euro strength is a killer.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                How do I answer this???  I am happy that your engagement with the Jag Super V8 is blissfull.  Congradulations...You compared your 2001 LexusLS w/a European Sport Package to a 2006 A8 and found it ponderous, slow and to have an unacceptable cabin noise level.The 2007  SClass was heavy and uninvolving and the CLS55 which is supercharged btw, always felt as if it were working hard, this compared to a 2001 ls?The Maserati, which is 100g's straight out the gate, you're worried about it's ""reliability, fuel costs, insurance costs, repair costs and availability of qualified mechanics. And it is pricy.""So you ended up with a Jag Super V8, but you don't tell us how it compares to the 2001 LexusLS...Why didn't you just buy another ls?  GS430? When it comes to handling, speed, high performance luxury sedans, nobody mentions Lexus, even with the new IS350 automatic or even Jag for that matter, heck not even Cadillac with the V series... It's the 3 Germans that are the high performance luxury kings still...            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                How do you guys find the time to post so much?Maxhonda,I been out of school twelve years now and back then, my favorite luxury automaker was a Cadillac and still is to this day.  Cadillacs were pure luxury back then in 1990 and '91 when I begin to take interest in the product.  I don't care for Mercedes or BMW back then.  I thought they were ugly as sin except few of the models.  I like them (luxury imports) a lot better now but if I had a limited amount of income to choose between the STS, SClass, or 745Li, I would choose the STS.  Although the  SClass and 745Li maybe a better car than the STS and in another league, the STS is an excellent luxury car without explaining itself to anyone.magnetohpone,What you said about Cadillacs being seen in poorer neighborhoods is somewhat spot on.  That might been one of the reasons why I liked Cadillacs so much but calling them chump change is way off base.  Most Cadillacs around here are driven by older people but more than 1/4ths. of age groups driving older models are younger people.  However Matt, in the future, what you said about Cadillacs being driven by poorer people seems to be racist if you know what I mean.  In poorer neighborhoods, African Americans predominantly live in those neighborhoods.  Although you did not say that but anyone can read between the lines.  So base on what you see, don't create a stereotype if you don't have a clue what's going on around you.  I can easily say only white people drive BMWs and Porches out of ignorance which is false so clean up your posts a bit, please.Now to anyone, you guys need to stop being critics.  I can tell you several number of Cadillacs that does get crossed shop between the high end competitors.  It may not happen as commonly like the LexusLS between  SClass and 7Series but it does happen.  The DTS may not be cross shopped according to you guys but it does and I can tell you some posters and their friends chose a DTS over a BMW, Lexus and Mercedes.  So, if the car meets certain peoples needs so beat it if Cadillac won them over from Lexus or Mercedes.Also for those people that suppose to be rich on here that did not look at a Cadillac.  Guess what, some percentage of people that are rich would never consider driving a Mercedes, Bentley, Rolls, BMW, or Lexus over a Cadillac also.  So you guys need to stop giving in stereotype and just worry about the automaker you like so much and cherish the car you are driving right now and stop speculating so much.Again, I will tell you this like I would tell any of my friends that Cadillac, IMO, makes the best looking cars than anyone.  Just about all the Cadillacs currently are drop-dead gorgeous and I can't say the same much about the luxury imports except a few.  That is the reason I like Cadillac so much because of styling.  So, take it whatever you want but that is my bias opinion.Lexus cars are nice but no excitement in styling and always tend to follow.Mercedes are nice especially the gorgeous SClass 500/55 but Mercedes does not stand out anymore because they are being copied off of by anyone from Asian like Lexus and Acura.BMWs creating a new regime like Cadillac is in styling but their cars are funky looking to me like the new 7 and Z4.Jaguars have the most beautiful interior designs in its class but the exteriors are too old school and boring.  I can't understand why anyone one consider the exterior of the Jaguars gorgeous anyhow.  They simply are not.Audis are cutting edge in All-wheel drive and looks to be a contender in a few years but shared platforms a little too much like VWs. is turning me off.So, therefore Cadillac is the leader in styling direction, among the top in technology and best of all.  They are original and they never imitate or duplicate.  That is why I like them so much.J ""CaddyLac""            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                How do you know that it is not in Lexus' best interests to reposition themselves?  The hershey chocolate and dell example you have given are exercises in blunder and chaos.We all know Dell was mass-market right from the beginning like Toyota or Ford.  Comparing Dell or Hershey or Coke with lexus is like comparing Toyota with lexus, doesnt make sense at all. Neither Dell, nor Hershey or Coke are luxury brands.  They sell by the tens-of-millions every year.   If Toyota wants to reposition itself where Benz is then yes, we must cite these examples.  Lexus must evolve from ""Value HELM"" to ""premium HELM"" in my opinion otherwise the long term future of lexus BRAND will be in jeopardy.  Lexus must continue to evolve and re-invent itself, and in order to do so it has to stop cut-rate pricing and price its products head-to-head with BMW-7 or Audi A8.  OVER CONFIDENCE:  NOBODY IS ASKING TO MATCH SClass PRICING. IF ls460 IS PRICED HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH 7Series IT WILL STILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT PRICE ADVANTAGE COMPARED TO BENZ. How much time do you need before it sinks in?  Lets not forget what happened to Neanderthal man, it did not evolve so it was eliminated from the evolutionary cycle.  TRIED AND TESTED: NEANDERTHAL MAN USED TRIED AND TESTED FORMULA FOR SUCCESS, AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED, IT STOPPED EVOLVING, AND WAS FINALLY ELIMINATED.

"                How is the SClass #2, when the a8 is better at EVERYTHING than the MB? I dont buy the XJ's 2nd place finish, but I certainly would not have put the MB in there.Oh and topspin, precision crafting and engineering and reliability should not be mutually exclusive. If you want to compare watches, I think in many ways my own Breitling Windrider is similar to the LexusLS. It never lets its superior craftsmanship and engineering stand in the way of its functionality, as its a ""watch for professionls"" first and a piece of jewelry second. Lexus is kind of like that.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                How many times do we have to go over this?  I said that price is but one factor, among others like reliability, dealer service, etc. etc. all those things that Lexi love to gloat about.  No one here every said that price was the sole reason. ""As pointed out here, the lease difference b/w a $75K SClass is only about a couple hundred $ higher than a $63K LexusLS. Are you implying that a greater proportion of those who lease the LexusLS cannot afford to lease an SClass ? Yet the SClass sells so pitifully against the LexusLS. I submit that price is the least of the factor, especially consdiering the higher prestige of the MB over the Lexus. But of course, you have your position which is unshakeable, so let us move on....""Seriously, everyone doesn't lease.  You really seem to forget this.  Of course a few hundred dollars shouldn't, and I say shouldn't make a difference for a buyer in this segment, but this is all irrelevant to a person buying with cash and/or financing.

It took me awhile to read b/w the lines, and Len was quite astute to figure it out, that you were being facetious with your *in-your-face* condemnation of the LS460 as a Toyota ripoff. Do you suppose that the Lexus design team and the Camry deign team exchanged design notes so that their output looks similar ? If you follow the trends starting from the ES330, through the IS350, you will see the Lexus design language showing through. The new Avalon won lots of praise from its radical departure from a stodgy style of the past. Now its selling like hot cakes. And it will appear Toyota has another winner in the 2007 Camry. As for the LS460, the jury is out, although consensus opinion shows its gonna be a winner.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"                Hybrids in Japan are seen as only fads. Even tho gas prices are high, the gasoline is not as taxed as ours is here in the states for example. Factor in a higher salary grades and cost of living compared to America, and the price is even lower than in London, US, and the mother of all-out g gauging, Sweeden.The new thing to do in Japan to is to twin-turbo charge 4 and 6-cyl. cars and add direct injection. The power of a V8 with the fuel economy of say, a Chevy Aveo.I can see the 600H and MB Bluetec failing miserly as the current lsand previous MB do not register on the scale there. Not because the weren't attainable(plenty of elite in Japan), but because of the frugal consumer base that Japan has. Multi-Millionaires driving the '91-'96 version of the 300ZX Turbo. Or Supra. Or RX-7/8, Or if you're really loaded, Skyline GT-R. Most in Asia are favoring the large Audi than any other make, as witnessed by the A8 outselling the SClass(not 550 in Asia). The US will be the main carrier for the LS600h. Lexus knows this. Why do you think the lsis not sized for the Asian market with their alley-like streets? And this go round, Lexus has vowed to step into the league's with Europeans, on their on turf. But as witnessed by the disgust with the IS/GS(2814 and 3789 sales, respectively), they have there work to pry the A8, S, 7, and even AJ faithful from the performance luxuries.....

"                I absolutely adore the A8. The car has some unusual features that are only available in cars costing 2-3 times as much.The interior quality, build, and layout is tops amongst it's competitors. The exterior is very elegant and classy.In my almost a year of ownership, the car has delivered 15k absolutely trouble-free miles, and I've got the W12, the car CR says not to buy. BEWARE: On your eventual car purchase, do not read into what the mag says as they gave the Jag and MB's black dots all around, yet these cars continue to deliver some of the best quality in the class, especially the Jaguar, considering that it is right there with Lexus on many fronts.I ordered my a8 W12 with every option under the sun. It does have bluetooth and Sat. radio. I ordered the full-leather dress up from roof to floor, the B&O sound system, park assistm, rear fridge, 20"" wheels, dual pane glass(std.), solar fan in the sunroof(for cooling/heating while the car is parked), and the Audi Extended Protection plan up to 100k miles, something ANY luxury buyer should get on ANY luxo car as these cars hae enough electronics to keep Bill Gates up at night And the car's price range is very flexible, from $68k up to a wallet-crushing $155k.All in all, I couldn't have bought a better purchase last year. I sold the S65 AMG last year and traded the 760iL on the W12. Neither of those cars offered the complete blend of luxury, comfort, and performance as the W12 did, altho the new W221-platformed Merc. may do it better than the Audi judging from my earlier drives. But the car is still hugely competitive, and if AWD is a must, there is no car on the road today(yet) that can come close to the A8, which has quattro standard, and this makes the A8 as sure-footed as a mountain goat..

"                Hi All,  First off, Merc1 welcome back to the board..We certainly missed you! It's good to have someone on the other side to keep these debates so lively. ?Oac,  I heard you on the Lexus designs...I still think the original designs that Lexus rolled out were the best ones..The SCwas a great design that Lexus fumbled in it's 2nd generation..Now the SClooks like some retired person's car..The original LexusES even had a nice flair to it..The new one is just weird looking.Same goes for the LexusLS..They had the sleek profile and distinct look on the first car. The new '05 isn't bad, but you still can see the strong similarity to the olderSClass..I hope they don't do the same thing in '07. Didn't Lexus use Italian designers for their initial designs? (I know this was true for the GS)  ?As for Jaguar, their quality has steadily improved. From that perspective they're doing well. The newest XJ was the result of a design committee and it shows. The older car, while impractical, was much better looking. Ford has done a poor job of marketing Jaguar..Building cheap downmarket cars like the X-Type isn't the way to go..If that isn't enough, they've send some Detriot Exec to run the place...I really think they don't know how to manage a premier marque like Jaguar..Their Luxury nameplates save Volvo have lost a horrendous amount money. They continue to build cars that simply lack the amenities that the competition has..Their $75K XJ doesn't have a Navigation system as standard! They've got their work cut out for them! ?SV            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I admire your stout defense and relentless pursuit of lexus ""value"".  I get my data from a number of sources including manufacturer's websites, edmunds, yahoo, etc etc. You are not quoting any statistics on the ""actual"" transaction price of lsversus ""actual"" transaction price on S.  In the absence of such data I cannot count on your statement that buyers ""load"" their lswith so much equipment that it becomes 72K, just 4K short of S.  May be some of the buyers do, but we do not know the approximate or precise figures.  Regarding Build Costs:  We are not talking about build costs here.  This kind of logic confounds me.  How is build cost related to premiums.  Is it not true that if build costs are lower and ability to charge premiums is high, it will be a sweeter time for Lexus.  The logic that ""Lexus sells for less because build cost is less"" is irrational.  And the logic that charging less is some kind of marketing greatness by Lexus is also very strange.  Price advantage is the opposite of price premium, and thats my point.  The ""ability"" to charge ""premium"" compared to your competitor.I am yet to see a business which would not charge premium if it could.  Should I slow it down.  If my build cost is 100$. Competitor's build cost is 140$. Competitor sells for 200$. I sell for 170$, why because according to somebody's logic, my build costs are less.  How funny!!!Wouldn't I love to charge 200$ even if my build costs were 100$?  Wouldn't I love the extra sunshine and hay?  Wouldn't I love to stretch the front yard and send my kids to Harvard if my costs of maintenance were same? Wouldn't I love to have fun and kids with Angelina Jolie if my costs of keeping her were same as Jen? Thats my point! But in the end I have great admiration for ljflx for staying at the trench and holding his gun. Both lsand S are sweet, and it doesnt hurt me if lssells for 20K or 80K, its just that despite having a better product, lssells at cut-rate prices, which confounds me.    Lexus would do great if it priced lsat least as much as A8 and 7.  As far as BMW goes, its because BMW's V12 is underpowered, 438 hp versus 510 hp for benz and moreover, BMW is still the underdog in every measure including cachet, heritage (120 years for benz versus 60 years for BMV), agility, driving pleasure compared to S.

It's good marketing on their part. If they can attract an owner at theCClass Entry point and give them a good experience, the owner will likely move up the MB chain as income increases. All these predictions of doom for MB are grossly overstated. Every car company has it's bad times. I have to agree with Merc on his comments about the Blandness of the Lexus line. They came out in 1990 with excellent and cutting edge cars. (LS, LexusES, SC) Today, they don't offer anything especially appealing. The IS has little or no fit, the GS is lackluster, and the LexusLS has become the More reliable knockoff of theSClass. Don't even get me started on the LexusES or SC.  People will pay a premium for exclusiveness and ""perceived prestige."" The Lexus maybe better in areas of reliablity, service, etc, but MB still has originality and prestige on their side. Until Lexus gets a grip on producing original designs, they're always going to be knocked in this department. I've seen the pictures of the CLS, interesting concept, but I didn't think it was anything special in looks. Just pure subjective opinion here. To be honest, the only car I liked was the old XJ. Say what you want about Jaguar, but their designs provoked a real response from people. (except for the X-Type..Yeck!)SV            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I agree totally.  Infiniti's rocks and trees made some wonder what the cars looked, but the majority of buyers said ""oh well"".  You're right the new Q is their last time to get into the minds of buyers in this class.  When people want to spend big-money they think Mercedes, BMW and Lexus....and maybe Cadillac to a degree.  They don't think Infiniti.   Don't worry those cars I mentioned in my previous posts are totally out-of-budget, if you know what I mean.  For me it started in 1986 with the then-new-for 1986 300E, I won't say what my favorite brand was before that...the room would be shocked.  The Audi A8 has been one of favorite cars since it came here.  I love the conservative design and the interior.  The S8 or the Europe only A8 6.0 W12 model are truly awesome.  The A8 has 2 things working against in here.  One, is the Audi image, while it is changing, it still isn't up to MB and BMW, especially when people starting spending 60k and up.  Two, it's aluminum body I think has kept many away, too expensive to repair.  Now the A6 is about as good looking as a 4-door gets, in my opinion and I think the new A4 is going to be a looker too from the European models I've seen in books and on TV.  In short Audi is my third favorite luxury car. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Hi Everyone,   Diesel is a great technology. In Europe 50% of all new cars sold are Diesels. It's not a perfect solution, but a practical one to the current gas woes. This talk about Lexus hiking prices is crazy. Lexus has always appealed to the ""Objective"" buyer. Oppressive price hikes would simply eliminate the Value that the lshas over theSClass. I would have bought a SClass a long time ago, had the LexusLS been priced at that level. Lexus has done the right thing, in gradually raising the price. The consumer doesn't take kindly to a sudden price hike. However, as Lexus has raised prices, the lshas gotten even better. People will pay for increased functionality.Given that Lexus is trying to compete in Europe I doubt they'll be able to price themselves at the Germans level. I was just in the UK and had an opportunity to read some of their car mags..Their view of Lexus is almost OPPOSITE of what we read in US Publications. Can you believe it? I read a brief review of the lsand they downgraded it on driving dynamics. It seems to confirm my view that Lexus appeals to the objective buyer, and Mercedes, BMW to the subjective buyer. I don't think Lexus buyers are looking for something that will provoke emotion. On the other hand, Euro car buyers want something that provokes emotion. It's just a difference in perspective I think. The LS460 looks great, I have no doubt it will be a winner. I wish they had made AWD an option on the gasoline car, though. At least for the US market it's an important option to have. As for the L-Finesse theme, I'm not a big fan. While the lslooks great, the LexusES is a total letdown. The new car barely has any wood in it..The older car had a much nicer cabin to it. From a drivetrain perspective, I'm sure the new LexusES is a big improvement, but from purely a style perspective I find it disappointing. My 1992 LexusLS is nearing 100K miles. I replaced the tires with Bridgestone Turanza LS-V's and the car's ride is amazing. Quiet at 100 MPH and handles well. The SClass hasn't broken down yet..lol..It's a great car, I'm really enjoying it. It's the kind of car where you deliberately take a longer way to go home. You really don't want to put it back in the garage. I miss some of the technology the Lexus had: Bluetooth, Backup Camera, and Parking Radar, but the SClass has enough toys to keep me occupied. I'm watching the prices of the 2003 Jaguar XJ fall to the mid 20K range..It's a great value, especially since a lot of those cars have only 25-35K on them. It's the last of the timeless design style cars. My wife will really kill me this time if I bought one. I got away with the Mercedes because of my son, but I can't blame the Jag on him!-Sam            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I agree, my '01 seems just as bullet proof now as my '96 did. I also have not gotten the impression that the quality of the switchgear or anything else about Lexus interiors has in any way deteriorated. If anything I'd say its the opposite. Here's a '96 like my old oneAnd here's from an '05. Its absolutely no contest, and absolutely no way I'd go back to a '96. And even more so than the LexusLS, Lexus' other car's interiors have gotten amazingly better. Just compare the old RX to the new one, or the old SCto the new one. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I agree, the only thing that can really be the saving grace for Jaguar is unquestionably gorgeous cars. Despite being 10 years old, the outgoing XK is still a very good looking car. If it looked like the SC430, I'm sure that sales would've dropped to zero years ago. It makes me wonder if Ian Callum is the right man for the job. The new XK is good looking, but it looks as much like a V8 Vantage as it does an E-type.Talking about the current XJ, I'm not sure where the pricing should go. Is it still the '80s Jags that are killing the market value of a two year old XJ? Or does the market just not believe the car is worth the retail price Jaguar is asking?As a longer term strategy, I just dont think that trying to sell XJs in the $50-70K range can work, and I think that is the conclusion that the PAG management has come to. Ford has resources, but they have a lot on their plate to deal with. Jaguar is only a small part of that. In contrast, BMW, Mercedes, and Lexus can throw their full might behind their flagships, and redesign them every six to seven years. Even the beleaguered VWAG has managed to give Audi a lot more attention than Jag has been getting from Ford. I think the smarter way to go is to let the LS460, S450, 750, and A8 4.2 duke it out on their own.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I agree.  Lexus is likely going to come within a bumper of doing what he is now saying they should do, especially the LS460L and A8L. Slow and careful growth is the Lexus/Toyota way and it has worked brilliantly much to the dismay of the nearly the entire auto industry so there is no need to go radical with pricing.  Long money vs. short. I'm still reeling over the winner, not really Idol material IMO.  I would have picket Katherine.  What I really don't like is that the word was out that morning about Taylor winning, they cheapened the whole thing by basically letting the cat out of the bag.  To me he didn't even look surprised.  His reaction looked staged. I think someone will likely pick up Paris, Chris, Ace, Elliot and Katherine all to varying degrees of course.  When Clive Davis was talking about who sold what I was surprised that last year's winner actually sold anything.  She really wasn't that good, at least not then.  The finale show was the best episode since the initial trial episodes.  Toni Braxton and Elliot didn't make a good team though.  He over sang her by a mile because of her sultry style.  I agree the others will likely outshine Taylor over the long term.  He is just too goofy for me to take seriously most of the time and he looks 10-15 years older than he really is, so he likely won't be marketed to the kids.  Last, but not least I hope Paula gets some help during the off season. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I already posted on the lsthread but here goes again.I was given a 2004 pre-owned, euro-tuned with the 18"" summer tires and modern luxury package which had about 12,000 miles on it.This vehicle was better than the bare-bones lsthat I drove at a different dealership.This time, I found the driver's seat quite comfortable.The suspension created the illusion that I was riding on air and very high off the ground.The combination of seat and suspension made for a very relaxing ride. I see why so many people love this vehicle.The only negative and it was a big one is there was a quite noticeable hesitation when accelerating which I wouldn't expect from a $55,000 vehicle.Others have posted on the lsthread in response that they too have the same problem with their LexusLS.It is especially noticeable on turns when you either take your foot off the accelerator or apply the brake and then after the turn is finished, you attempt to re-accelerate. For a long fraction of a second, nothing happens.I would invite other LexusLS owners to please let me know if they have a similar experience.I couldn't get over how you can set the ac vents so they rotate from left to right continuously. I also liked how the rear window's sunshade removes itself when you put it in reverse so the rear-view camera can do its thing.I felt very relaxed driving this vehicle but would not consider buying it with that annoying and sometimes scary hesitation.

"                hi, ?Lexus is fine automobile no doubt. when it comes to being a high end brand Lexus just doesn't reach high enough.  the LexusLS is their top of the line vehicle.  a fine car but no comparison to the top of the line MB's. as for the RX...it is a highlander in disguise. and the LexusES...it is pure Camry.  as for the E being a 300C...the parts used in the C are from the last generationEClass.  MB and Chrysler don't swap platforms and just change the name and add some wood interior pieces. as for what Bill Gates drives who cares.  his car buying decision would not affect my choice one bit.  what brand laptop he purchases would be of more interest.  buying an MB has its fair share of status but to think thats the only reason a person purchases one is unfair stereotyping....like saying a Lexus is a poor mans Benz.  both are nice automobiles but MB still has the leg up on Lexus..imho.  one thing i think most would agree to is that nobody bends metal as nice as MB. no bland designs in their line up.

"                I am already thinking of trading my 2004  RX  (all my friends have seen it) for a sedan. I am considering the 2004 LexusLS, Audi A8L, and Jaguar XJ. I hope to drive the Audi and Jaguar this weekend.  I hated driving 90 minutes for service for the Audi. The Audi A6 was troublesome. I never had a problem with my Q45 (1994) or 2002 LexusLS, so I didn't mind driving for service. Don's comments on his XJ have encouraged me to lean towards the Jag. I worry about depreciation too.I will let you know what I think about my test drives.Scott in Florida            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I am another under 45 lsowner.  When I was considering purchasing my car in 04 my other choices were 530i, S4, and Cayenne S.  Very wide choices, indeed.  I wanted to get the best car for my wants and needs.  My second choice would have been S4 with manual tranny.  I am due for a new one this fall and my choices are LS460/600 or S8.  So handling is important to me (but is not everything) and the lsdoes not fail in that department.  Yes it leans too much but has excellent balance, steering and brakes for everyday driving.  I Put it in second gear and step on it on the on ramps, it goes (even with 17s)! But I would not buy the lsif I lived in an area that had twisty roads, lived in Germany where I could go 120 all day, or if I wanted to use on the track.  But I live in Sunny California, so the lsis good enough to exceed the speed limit every now and then.  Frankly, I would love to own a German car if their total package including the exterior, interior, handling, reliability, dealer service, and yes the big bad word VALUE exceeded Lexus's.  I like the S8 because it is beautiful inside and out and will be a great performer.  I am willing to live with its reliability but the dealer service and to a lesser extent the MMI are what I am afraid of.  Has anyone seen the A8 Audi Exclusive interior?  The wood and the leather are out of this world.  Just simply Exquisite.I do not put much thought to the Magazines because they only have the car for so long and they drive them mostly to test their performance.   By the way, one of the magazines rated the AMG E63 first, S6 second and M5 last!  Go figure Bimmer fans.  M5 must be an inferior product! NOT.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"                I am currently into the last year of a 3 year lease of a Lexus LexusLS and at this point I feel that I can give a good objective summary of this car.  (By the way, I have also leased BMWs, MB's Infiniti and Lexus in the past).Before I got this car, I had considered the a8 (SWB was not available at that time),BMW 7 and MBSClass.The a8 was so long that it would not fit in my garage and I felt like a limo driver.  I liked the ride but I was hesitant about Audi quality reputation and while I liked the interior, I was not in love with the exterior and it did not ""feel"" like a 70-80K car to me.  The SClass stole my heart in terms of looks and image.  But I had heard so many horror stories about electronics issues and with the lease price a good 400 per month more than the Lexus, I couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger.  If the price would have been within 200 per month, I would have taken a shot that the quality issues would not apply to my car.  But to stretch to 400 and be in the service shop was not my thing.  The 7Series did not feel luxurious enough to me for the price and, not that it's a bad thing, but I ""only"" felt like I was driving a big 3Series, a car I had and loved.So I went with the ""value"" play and to me it is a compromise. (another big reason was that I wanted blue tooth conductivity for hands free and the others didn't offer at the time).  While the car has a fantastic build quality and everything works the right way every time, it is not an inspiring car to drive.  I got it for comfort, reliability and convenience and it delivers very well on those.  However it definitely lacks the driving dynamics of the Euros.  It floats over the road and doesn't convey the feeling of control that one gets from the Euros mentioned above.  Sometimes I find myself getting a bit weary because I feel disconnected from the drive.  The seats are OK, like a nice couch but I prefer the firmer more supportive MB, BMW style.I wish the steering was more connected and tighter even if just in highway driving not canyon carving.Great radio, great electronics in the Lexus and one gets the idea that this car will continue to be fully functional and flawless for 200,000 miles or more.  All said, I think my next car will be European.  I love the new SClass and while I haven't driven one, I may be tempted especially if they bring a smaller engine at a lower price.  To me,that is still the king of the road luxury car with the most solid feel and good compromise between lux and sport (The last SClass I did drive). I look at the SClass and I think that it's the pinnacle and there's no where else to go (I wouldn't drive a Maybach,Rolls etc even if I could ever afford one or won the lottery)  Or maybe the BMW, if it improves with the next 7 with a turbo engine and fixing the electronic glitches.Lexus is still a value based company in my opinion.  Meaning that they must undercut the Europeans in price since they still lack in prestige even though it's amazing how far they've come in such a short time.  Dollar for dollar being equal or close, I would have gone with the SClass last time around, but while my heart wanted the S, my brain convinced me to go with the lswhich had more goodies for less money with the reliability aspect added in for good measure.  I think it would be premature for them to price their cars equal or close to the Euros. I for one would love to see them take a stab at a sport version (like AMG or M) with firm seats, tighter steering etc) but I think that the marketing types and bean counters are looking at the typical US Lexus owner who wants the best Caddy, Town Car ever made.  And it's that by a long shot.  Do they want to alienate their core clients or dilute their approach for the sake a few guys like us that rant and rave on Edmunds!  In the end, they are running a business to make a profit and to grab market share.  As long as they are very successful I don't think we will see them change their strategy.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I actually appreciate Lexus's restrained design and conservative approach.  Their cars may not be especially distinctive, but neither are they offensive or controversial.  The new RX and LexusES are strong and clean designs in my eye, and the LexusLS while ""boring"", is also very uncluttered and not likely to grow tiresome quickly.  Also, I'm sure the Lexus folks are watching closely the cold shoulder the BMW 7, 5 and Z4 are receiving and laughing all the way to the bank.  A true test is to take a look at some of the auto designs that still look good today.  The E38 BMW 7Series, the first generation Q45 and the first and second generation Lexus l SClass all still look clean and ""new"".  My 2 cents...            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I agree (with what I think you are saying).  When I suggested cannibalization, I wasn't suggesting that most Edmunds readers cross-shop the LexusES and lswith the GS.  However, I believe that there is a large population of buyers (and non-Edmunds-readers...Gasp!) out there who either want a Lexus because of either:    its reliability, luxury, and quietness;  its prestige, or (most likely); a combination of the first two.  So this group of buyers with their minds set on a Lexus walks into the dealership with a budget.  They may have plenty for an LexusES but not enough for an LexusLS, or they have barely enough for an LexusLS, but a GS is slightly more reasonable.Sorry, I don't have stats or articles to back this up.  This is just a hunch.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I am one that found the Audi a8 ride rather harsh and uneven and it was on the standard tires. I test drove it a while back so DonnFenn may be right that it is an early production problem. I am quite familiar with the old a8 as well, having driven and ridden in it often. I never felt that its' ride approached the refinement of the SClass or LexusLS. What I found disappointing was the new car ride was even less refined than the prior model. But I found the handling on the new A8 to be  excellent (better than before)and the interior was well crafted and definitely had high-end materials. I would rate the interior more in line with Lexus and Jaguar and above the MBSClass. It is unquestionably spacious and luxurious and a nice place to live in.My old office had a lot of Audi buyers, particularly the A4 and A6 and people often had problems, some pretty serious including tranny related problems, with the cars. But many people were quite loyal to Audi and the main reasons were the sportier handling and the AWD offered in all models. This is the Northeast and there has been an awful lot of snow lately so AWD is highly valued. What is interesting is a few Audi owners had Toyota and Lexus suv's in their garages and in the big rain and snowstorms they showed up with them and left the car at home for their spouse.DonnFenn - I spotted a Q45 driving around a local strip mall the other day. It was in a dark burgundy color and I did a double take on it as the car seemed perfectly made for that color. Then the guy pulled right along side me and for the first time I realized that the Q's engine is as quiet as an LexusLS. I asked the guy how he liked it and he said he loved it.

"                I am really in a quandary over the SClass 4Matic and the LexusLS.  The lsis a great car with fantastic luxo interior, sound system, very quick and bullet proof quality.The MB is more my style in terms of looks, drives great (I like the Euro ride a bit more than Lexus), feels like a tank, and has all wheel drive.  I wouldn't be surprised with a few visits to the service dept. for some electrical ""adjustments"".  By the way, on 2 different test drives in 2 different cars, I experienced 3 problems first hand: Tilt steering wheel wouldn't tilt down after I moved it up, air suspension wouldn't adjust and door locks would not close!  Each salesman said that it may be a fuse or something.  Am I nuts for still considering anyway.The real issue for me is that with the heavily incentivised pricing, leasing and interest rate from MB the cars are very close in price.  That's a tough pill for me to swallow when it's fixed in my mind that MB is the far more established prestige player and for the same $, it's hard to swallow emotionally if not rationally.  Throw in free maintanince and all wheel drive too.That said, the LexusLS may be the best luxo car in the world for comfort, quiet and quality.  The Levinson sound is fantastic and blue tooth is a real plus.  In addition, it really gets my goat that on the top of the line SClass you don't get things like xenon lights as standard.  The TL has them and blue tooth for almost 1/3 the retail price.Regarding RL.  I think that was their attempt at an ls/Q45 competitor and at the time it probably provided about 80% of those attributes for 80% of the price.  Now it's so outdated.  The new one looks like it might be a winner.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I believe you have made serious blunders in most of your Lexus related posts by implying that somehow ""STAYING THE COURSE"" means keep offering BEST in CLASS products at CUT-RATE prices.  Why should Lexus not charge head-to-head with A8 and 7.  It will be immensely damaging to Lexus and lsthat customers become ADDICTED to cut-rate pricing and always ONLY LEXUS to provide that largesse and not germans.  The germans are not under any price pressure from Lexus because they know that people will buy their arrogant products and provide them with huge largesse, all the time while Lexus keeps its prices cut-rate.  This is a mind-boggling hypocrisy.  BEST in class products deserve best in class pricing. It is nobody's business to PREACH Lexus the ""CUT-RATE"" mantra. Those who want cut-rate can buy Avalon. Its simple as that.  It confounds me how people have the nerve to say that lsdespite being the best product among its competitors has to offer ""VALUE"" while the germans should charge GAZZILION dollars for fake products.Tagman, dont be delusional. Wake-up and smell the roses. Your comments are beyond rational.  STAYING the COURSE does not mean making customers addicted to cut-rate pricing, it means continuous improvement and that means playing head-to-head with A8 and 7.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I agree with most of what you said with regard to pricing vs. sales volume of ""cars"", except the fact that MB's disadvantage in higher prices should be more than offsetted by their much wider model line-up with more engine/model variations. You should be able to sell more if you have more choices to offer. I suspect that too is going to change as Lexus will gradually offer a wider variation of choices in the future. Lexus hadn't been in business for 15 years & they have already done more than anyone expected. I also agree with ljflx that the Lexus RX is car-based and is really a raised LexusES station wagon(that's why they call it cross over), & trying to seperate RX's sales from the cars' sales in an effort to imply that Lexus can only sell SUV's may not make much sense, although they often lump the RX  together with the true truck-based SUV's with real off-road capabilities like the GX & LX.

"                I can't believe my good fortune.  I was called by a research company to evaluate 3 automobiles.  I had an inkling that it might be the new BMW. :-)The three cars were Lexus LexusLS, MB SClass and the BMW 745i.I have to say right off, the car looks much better in person than it does in photos.  Though the trunklid still looks just a bit awkward, it definitely looks better in person.I will try to recall all the details that I can.The headlamps are bi-xenon and have the ""halo"" effect like the 2001 5Series.  VERY cool.The 7Series bases at 71,650.  Which is significantly more than the current 7Series. That includes the usual stuff, including an ""active"" type suspension.  The car they had there was FULLY loaded. Had auto door closers, the trunk was auto open and close and was a sight to behold.  I DEFINITELY would want that. It is just amazing to watch.The best way I can describe the interior is that it is like sitting in a living room full of Italian furniture.  With this interior, BMW has definitely taken a high-tech path to luxury.  It definitely has a luxurious feel, but if you think of Italian furniture, sleek, VERY modern, you will know what I am talking about.  I think BLACK will be the best color for this interior.Also, the standard wood has a matte finish. I would definitely upgrade to the shiny stuff.  The matte is ok, but doesn't look as rich as shiny wood.The seats are fantastic!  Think of sitting in a catchers mitt, all snug and cozy. That's exactly the way it felt. The seats are just awesome, and the controls for them, which are on the side of the center console are unique. There is a rotary control and you turn it either way after selecting the portion of the seat control that you want to change.  Very unique, and very effective.  Of course it had the heating and cooling seats.  ANOTHER COOL feature is the rear window shades. THEY ARE ELECTRIC!!  There are controls on either rear door that control the rear quarter window shade of the rear door shade.  They can also be controlled from the front seat. The center console is HUGE!  VERY wide, but again, very elegant in a high-tech way.  When you open up the two center ""armrests"", it is cavernous inside.  A definite improvement over my 740's armrest storage, which is non-existent. :-)The i-Drive is FANTASTIC!  It is the most amazing thing I've ever tried.  Also, the center hood, which I complained about in the past as looking stupid.  Well, guess what, in person it looks REALLY good. It blends in surprisingly well, and doesn't look like an add-on, which is the way it looks in the pics to me.The rear seat passengers have a drop down mirror, like the Mercedes, except that there is only 1 and it is in the center.  The other feeling that strikes me about the interior, is it is very much like a cockpit, especially with the brushed chrome overhead console.  The rear seat legroom has NOT improved on this i model.  I thought maybe it would be, but with the frontseat set comfortably for a six footer, the knee room is still about the same, maybe just a tiny bit more than the current 7Series .The rear seats were also VERY comfortable, but again, it is like sitting in really comfortable leather furniture. You sit IN to the seat, not on them.  It would DEFINITELY be my choice for a long-distance drive.

"                I can't help but ask this.  You're stating that GM has caught up to the best in interior design, and you're basing this on a picture that allegedly shows similarities between the new A6 and a Chevy truck, so you mean to tell me that when Cadillac uses that very same interior design for their 60K Escalade family there is something special or top-notch about it?  If the new A6 interior has flaws (and it does), and resembles a GM truck then what would you call that same interior design in a 60K Caddy truck?    Also, the Chevy/Slade interior is about 10 years behind a VW or Audi in quality of materials, even if their design is similar (not that I agree with that they are). M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I am able to look at things objectively when others do the same...believe it or not.  Its only when I read things likeSClasss and SClass aren't luxury cars or that rear side airbags are a gimmick does the bs meter go into the red.""Talking of the new GS tho', two new engines and a hybrid are on the way - the 3.5L V6, that should put out 280+hp, the 4.6L V8, that should put out ~350hp, and the 450h (3.5L V6 mated to a single/or dual battery) with >330hp, then you got a real killer line-up in this segment. All of these by MY2007/08.""This would be true if the others were going to just stand still.  Lexus has better watch out for the Infiniti M35/45 lineup.  It is just a matter of time before the E500 gets a new V8 and the 545i becomes the 360hp 550i, via the 7Series's new V8.  The hybrid will be an interesting car no doubt, but I'm betting on at least 400hp there if they want to be taken seriously by the performance crowd.  While 400hp isn't going to even come close to the E55 or M5 or next RS6 it will provide an interesting alternative, mainly for being green.  I see it more competing with the 440hp STS-V and Jaguar's S/XJ Type R's that that have around 400hp, but the German midsize tuner cars, 400hp isn't going to do much of anything. ""Now, back to our regularly scheduled programming, about how the LexusLS is driven by old, blue-haired retired folks, while MBs and Audis are owned by yuppy 30-somethings...right?"" Of course not in every case, but I bet the demographic for Mercedes is younger, and I'm sure Audi and BMWs are.  The lsand LexusES in particular are bought by more ""mature"" folks.

"                I concur HP. Take for instance my '01 SClass. 41,000 miles on the odo when I got rid of it to take possession of my '03 S8. Only but two probs: The crazy COMAND probs everyone had and the failure of 1 HID bulb premuturely. That is it. And my '91 classic 560 SEL was a model enviable reliability, no probs whatsoever until I traded it in '95 for the new 7Series L. I should've definetely kept as a collectors car(and it's still inmensely popular here in NY because they never die, especially the old 300SD's) because it was truely Benz before the wrong hands got to it.CR had this car blacked-out from engine to trans to electricals to even the comfort level, which was interesting as the car was quite comfortable, ahead of all Germans in '01. What they don't tell you is that for every ""eventual"" prob they think the car will have, they'll mark it out. Check every single European car tbey test and it tells the story of bad electricals. Not everySClass/500 had bad quality then. If so, why are there so many still on the road with such bad quality? Plenty of '00/01's can be found on the road today, many being with the original owners. Would someone actually think that a person in their sound body and mind would pour thousands into a ""piece of junk"" like this? Hardly. The same can be said about Lexus. Not all of them experience ""trouble free"" operation.And now to Audi, which CR gives mixed reviews. First they say that the A8 is flat out subpar, but turn back one page and the A6 4.2(which has the same running gear as the A8) is flawless. How's about that? But interestingly enough, they save some of the heat on my '06 W-12, which is quite interesting as the Phaeton W-12 scored horridly so, again the same running gear.Personally, I wouldn't believe one ioda that came out of that mag. And you're right, exactly how many of the German cars you see on the side of the road? Not many, if any. It's just yet another smear campaign in the pursuit of ""perfection"".......

"                I couldn't agree with you more re the reliability of MB in the 70's and 80's.  They were very reliable COMPARED to the competition at that time.  Meaning that when you drove off the dealer's lot things didn't start falling off the car within 10 miles like some American cars at the time. Meaning that the things that broke down could be fixed rather quickly and wouldn't strand you.  More annoyances than anything else.  Meaning that if you serviced it regularly you could expect to put 200K on one of their engines and that the car wouldn't rust out and would stay rock solid.  These were exceptional qualities at that time.Then the bar was raised much to the benefit of all of us.I've owned 2 Lexus's, 3 MBs and 2 BMWs.  I currently drive an LexusLS.  When shopping for my luxo car I had determined that the SClass was number one for me.  Best riding and styling and more luxurious than the 7Series.  BUT I couldn't justify the price difference against the LexusLS.  Especially when I factored in that the S had its share of problems.The lshas been bullet proof and flawless. For me I would say that the BMW and MB cars are better at driving dynamics including seat comfort, performance, steering and road feel.Lexus is plain and simply, the best quality you can buy as far as reliability and the way it's screwed together.Will I get another lswhen my lease is up?  I'm not sure since I do prefer the better dynamics of the Euros but I need to find the combination of quality and value.  By the way, even in this segment, when someone says ""it's not about the money"", it's always about the money.  It's a very very rare cat that can make a purchase and not blink about another 20-50K.  If that were the case then I think all these buyers would also consider the new Bentley Sedan and they could consider a Maybach and then a Rolls....I also think that Lexus is having so much success with their ""soft"" riding cars that they wouldn't want to turn off their loyal customer base by creating cars with sharper dynamics.  Why change a successful formula?            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
                I did get Automobile today and saw that GS comment. The car does look sleek in the picture they show. What is a bit confusing is that it seems AWD may only be put on the V-6 but maybe Automobile got it wrong.Next to it is the story about the 12cyl A8. I must say I think the Germans have lost their minds with these rocket power engines. The V-8 power and 23mpg I get in the LexusLS with a 6.5 second 0-60 is more than sufficient and is a beautiful blend of power and good gas mileage. These super powerful engines are putting excess on top of excesses and you hardly ever need or can use the power anyway. The German carmakers would serve themselves a lot better to invest in building the cars better and improving their reliability problems. I'm also no fan of Audi's new corporate grill. The one on the current A8 is bold and beautiful and should be left alone.The funny story in automobile is on page 34 where they accuse VW of copying the Lexus HPX style with its possible future C1 hatchback. Now I must say I like this C1 Crossover but that is most likely because I like the HPX so much - and it is a copy.            ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I was wondering what the Escalade had to do with the cars in this topic. I'm glad I wasn't the only one disturbed by Merc1's comments.The interior of the A6 looks horrible, the interior of the 5Series is better, but still stark and business like. As far as I'm concerned Lexus has been doing the best interiors for years and cadillac seems to be headed more int he lexus direction, while the Germans are doing God knows what. The STS interior is a definite improvement over the CTS and we all know the interior was the biggest source of criticism for the CTS. Assuming the CTS' interior upgrade in '05 makes it looks like the STS the CTS could definitely become one of the class leaders.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I didn't mean the Camry comparison to be taken literally, it was to emphasize the fact that Lexus takes no risks whatsoever in the design.And, visually, I see no similarities between the Lex LexusLS and the MercSClass. The new Merc SClass went for a more refreshing image. The happy face lights and a lighter overall presence do represent a certain design risk. I *do* know people who prefered the more conservative and massive presence of the old MercSClass. So I have to give kudos to Mercedes for taking some risk with the new design, and going for discontinuity. Lexus does no such thing - there are no adventures in design whatsoever. No one will ever say ""I don't like it at all!"", but no one will ever say ""It's a gorgeous car!"" either, when refering to the design itself.Don't get me wrong - the Lexus is a phenomenal car: superbly engineered and balanced and all. But it is truly not a car that is *passionate*. Neither is the BMW 7Series, by the way, which I find equally unexciting design wise. The Audi A8 has class Audi design elements in there, it is recongizable. Not that Audi ever does for big risks in their design, either. It's clean lines, but also somewhat unexciting.I guess that it's simply the fact that *all* cars are starting to look more and more similar, since, like politicians, they morph themselves into something that appeals to the lowest common denominator. That leads to a certain blandness.The Jaguar here has the ""classic"" edge pure and simply because it *is* the oldest design. Updated and all, but still. If the spy shots I have seen of the new model are anything to go by, I will not truly consider the new car, just like I didn't consider the XKR all too seriously after the XJS. The newer models are far more anonymous.You would think the success of the New Beetle or the kudos the New Mini get would make car designers see that people do reward originality and classic, recognizable design cues. If I were Jag, I would make the new XJ look like the old one, with updated lines and an utterly new base. Keep it different. I would not go for the SClass design, only bigger, which seems to be the road ahead.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I didn't mean to imply that the Audi isn't a fine automobile, just that it didn't ""seem to me"" to be as solid as the MB.  This could just be my perception, but nothing came close to the vault like feel of theSClass.  As for the length issue, I didn't realize that the new SClass was longer than the A8 L.  I guess for me, I didn't see the major upgrade from the A6 to the A8 that I saw from the E to the S in MB other than the size.  It's great that you love your car and I understand why.  I was also just a bit nervous about electrical issues with the first year model when it came out as well.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I disagree with you on many counts. A Lexus is not as ""sturdy"" as a BMW? The 7Series L in my family is nowhere near as sturdy as the GS300 and ES300 also in the family, despite costing a lot more.Of course the Lexus will not have the same ""nimble"" performance as the BMW. It's not made to. But it does have superior quality, a nicer interior (IMO), superior navigation, better dealership experience, etc.And the  RX  driven by moms who don't want a minivan stigma? A minivan can seat 7-8, the RX only 5. Lexus purposely did not add a third row because the vehicle is not aimed at moms. Moms use minivans to haul around kids for carpool and go out with the grandparents, something the RX wasn't designed to do and can't do.Maybe your mind about the  RX  being a tall Camry will change in a few years when all Lexus models will be independent of Toyotas.

"                I do agree with a lot of what you posted. There can be a mental block buying something at close to $100K price point, regardless of what it is. Anecdotally, my wife and I are in the process of buying a third home. The price tag is $429K and since it is an investment property, the bank wants us to put down 25%. That is $107K out of our pocket. Adding closing costs and other costs, we'll put down close to $115K. The house is currently in escrow and should close later this month. Now I say this just to make the point that buying a $100K  SClass should not have been a problem for me, but I'd rather put that amount of money on a house which will appreciate rather than to make a point of a social status that may be associated with owning a marque MB superstar car. Having said this, I am in the market for a $75K LS4xx by 2006 ! Would I consider an SClass in my purchase choice ? NOPE ! And it ain't because of its price either.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I don't get it when you talk about all these engines and platform options. MB's S had two engines in the affordable range for their base cars - a 275HP and a 303 HP when I shopped in 2001. The lshad one engine, the 290HP. The A8 had one engine, a 310 HP and they had just discontinued the SWB edition because they sold less than 500 of these in the two preceeding years in the US per the dealer I shopped at. I haven't seen much change since then except that Audi brought back the slow selling SWB this year. I'm not counting in theSClassand SClass because they are very low selling custom cars for all intent and purpose. Kudos to MB for the limited production cars and options that no one else offers (even in the base cars) but anyone shopping for the more generic cars isn't dealing with as much variety as you describe. With MB - when you buy the more generic SClass as more than 90% of all buyers do (or E or anything else) you are also paying the freight for the variety that they offer even though you chose to pass on those options. If you want to be as full service as that you average in the overhead and other costs that allows that versatility onto each and every car. But if you consider a SWB car with one engine and a LWB car with another as a big amount of choices than I guess you are right. But it's only one more than Lexus and it won't last much longer as Lexus has said they will offer a LWB car in 2007. ?As for the V12 - that's coming as well from Lexus or a hybrid variant of it which is much a smarter way to go. But let's see if Audi can even sell 250 of their V12's in a year. MB sells about 1500 and BMW about 700 on average. There aren't many who want it or are willing to pay for it.

"                I don't have a clue as to what you are talking about. I never said there was a wait list for the LexusLS. I said my dealership (not the US or even a dealership 30 miles away) was sold out for April and that the Euro lsis hard to get around here. Go back and read my posts and tell me where I said there was a wait list. As for 2007 I am speculating and I honestly believe there will be so much demand for an lshybrid that it will be a hard car to get at that time. What facts could I possibly have to support that other than my own intuition. Let's see how the RX hybrid plays out  - that will certainly give the indications of what is to come. Someone else also said there is a long waitlist for the Prius. As well waitlists have to be tied in some way to production volume. Anyone can create a wait list - just produce a handful of cars.  Now - diesel cars have never been easy to sell here. I don't know anyone that has any desire to even look at one. This has nothing to do with MB and everything to do with how the American public buys cars. It buys gas engines because that is what it has been trained to do and that is how the business model is set up. Hybrids don't change that model, diesels do. Business models don't change very easily. Nor will they change when there is a logical alternative that maintains the current model. This is not about Benz at all. Why else would MB only commit 3000 CDI's for the US market. Because they are uncertain about diesel demand and market reserach doesn't give them any confidence that they can sell more.Boo20 claimed that there were year+ wait list for cars across the whole US - in some cases ordinary E-500's, not even AMG's. So I look at my sunday paper and I see a bunch of them advertised for sale - prices and all - both ordinary cars and AMG's. Plus that was just a partial list. Thus I couldn't buy his story. Persoonally I couldn't care less as I was not in the market for any of the cars he was touting anyway.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think the next Q45 will change that greatly.  Acura doesn't have anything to compete against cars like the A8, 7Series,SClass, LexusLS, XJ. Neither does Volvo.

"                I don't think it's necessarily Lexus alone that will be trouncing Mercedes-Benz in coming years... there are three main companies that have really upped their ante, and one is supposedly going to be as high of a seller as BMW and Mercedes-Benz by 2010:Audi- strongest MB/BMW competitor, because it has luxury and German engineeringInfiniti- very sporty; closer to BMW than Mercedes-BenzLexus- the complement to Infiniti, Lexus is to Mercedes-Benz as Infiniti and Audi are to BMW. Their cars are about plush rides and (recently) high speeds, not necessarily award-winning handling.However, Mercedes-Benz and BMW won't be standing still, people! The new SClass proves how hard M-B is trying, I just don't think they're trying hard enough in the crucial-for-U.S. SUV market. The new GL is a pathetic attempt to dethrone the LX470 and Range Rover, for it has no road presence and no mystical ""identity"" like the Range Rover. The ML is okay, but it's no X5 on the road, and the interior isn't even close to Lexus's GX and Audi's new Q7, even VW""s Toureg. The only thing it has going for it is a relatively low price.However, in the sedan market, all these manufacturers are stalwarts. Mercedes and Lexus are the powerhouses in the huge luxo-sedan market, with their new 380hp V8s. BMW isn't far behind with a 360hp V8, which is most likely going to gain more power in the next 7Series. Audi isn't far behind, because they're going to adapt the Q7's 350hp FSI V8, which is supposed to be a significantly better performer than the current 4.2, in the 2007 A6 and A8 models. Infiniti's engine used to be the strongest, but is now mid-pack with its 340hp 4.5L. Jaguar isn't worth mentioning... 300hp just isn't enough any more...As you can see, everyone's moving in a fast-paced market- and I believe that the three aforementioned manufacturers, especially Audi and Lexus, will be playing a huge role in the future. Just to let you know: the Audi A6 is officially the world's best selling premium sedan- that's a big surprise to me, but I'm sure most of the sales are coming from the hugely influential Chinese and German markets, each where Audi is the best-selling luxury brand.

"                I am honestly flabbergasted.  You claim (post 3711) to believe that if 2 products are of identical desirability except for prestige, the more prestigious can&#146;t command some level of price premium, and still sell the same number of units?  Do you see that your view implies that if two products are priced the same, they will sell the same number of units, despite one being higher in prestige and equal in all other ways?  Does this truly make sense to you?  Prestige doesn&#146;t have a value that people will pay extra for?  Frankly, if I can&#146;t get you to agree on something that follows from elementary economic theory, then I am very close to giving up discussing the whole sales/price thing with you.  There has to be an agreement on basic principles for rational discourse to take place.You keep wanting to look at Lexus vs MB as on a model by model basis, saying that on a overall (all SUVs + all cars) basis, MB&#146;s unit sales performance is explained by higher model-by-model prices, and that the higher prices aren&#146;t simply compensation for higher prestige/heritage.  Well, if that were true, wouldn&#146;t we find that the model matchups where MB is most expensive (relative to Lexus) are the ones where MB sells poorly, and that the matchups where MB is priced similarly to or less than Lexus are the ones where MB sells well?  In fact the exact opposite is true.  It is the matchups where MB is priced similarly to or less than Lexus where MB has its greatest sales weakness.  The C-class compared to the LexusES and IS.  And the M-class, compared to the RX and GX.  In the other lines, where MB is priced higher than Lexus, MB generally sells the same or higher numbers than Lexus?quite the opposite of what your theory implies.  (The only exception is the G vs LX, where MB is priced higher and does sell less; but since the LX isn&#146;t a big volume seller itself, the unit [as opposed to percentage] difference isn&#146;t large, so this doesn&#146;t go very far in explaining why Lexus outsells MB).Here&#146;s my theory.  I think that prestige/heritage has a value, and that people will pay extra for it.  But people who are concerned about prestige will, if they can afford it, buy towards the high end?if they buy a C the neighbors will know that they&#146;ve got the cheapest MB.  So MB is able to extract a bigger &#147;prestige premium&#148; (pricewise) on the E and S than on the C or ML350, for example, and still sell well.  And since people at the low end are not as concerned about prestige as those at the mid-high end, other factors become more important?like reliability, roominess, etc.  So in my view it isn&#146;t price that explains MB&#146;s sales vs Lexus?it is PRODUCT (or product, reliability, service, etc).  For the C, where MB sells fewer units than Lexus despite lower starting prices, maybe those factors are roominess, reliability, service.  As for the ML?well, you&#146;ve said yourself that MB has a product problem there, that the vehicle isn&#146;t that desirable.Again, if your price theory were true, it would be the E and S with the (relative) sales problems, not the C and ML.

"                I am not sure if I like the new CLS. Edmunds is saying that it will be more expensive than theSClass. I think the CLS does look like the LexusES in the front a bit. The rear reminds me of an Aston Martin concept. As for the LexusLS. I like the refreshed model the more and more I see it. It is much better looking IMO. It looks more aggressive and I think that might be exactly what it needs. I am seriously considering the purchase of 04 XJ. I am totally in love with the car. Just by looks alone.

I suspect it will be shown either this month at the Tokyo auto show or in Jan at Detroit.   Then again the Japanese like to wait until the last minute so if it doesn't make either one of those shows it might not show up until the New York show in April, since the car will be a 2007 model.

                No one at Lexus ever said the LF-S was the next GS. In fact I remember reading GS board posts in which posters believed the LF-S was going to be the next LexusLS. I believe it was C&D that did show a picture of it at the Tokyo show and then said it was the next GS under the picture. But that was the only place I saw that. That story is what made me think it was the next GS. lenscap - I can definitely see a lot of the LF-S style in it but I preferred the rear lights on the concept. I'm really anxious now to see it in person. You are right that in the past the production car was a nearly 100% twin of the concept. That was particularly true in the first RX.            ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I drove the A8 in August and had test drove it earlier. I was disappointed both times. The MMI went dead on me so many times that I lost count of it on a 250 mile trip. It got so bad on I95 that I had to pull over onto the shoulder, not once but 3 different times with cars buzzing by at 75mph. The car has a fairly harsh ride and to me it lacks the beautiful refined rides of the LexusLS and theSClass. Styling wise the car is an absolute beauty and to me its only weak point is the rear lights. The handling (which is good, not great) compromises the ride far too much for my tastes of what a luxury car should ride like (I was on the 18"" tires and hear the 19"" is even more harsh). There has to be a reason why Audi (on average) sells only 2500 of these annually. Sales jumped to 4000 last year but are already retreating back. The car looks great in person, and is great on paper but misses the mark as a luxury car for me and obviously for much of the US given Audi has a 5% marketshare. After the frustrating and distracting experience I had with that MMI I would never consider the car even if it had a ride I loved. Things that were simple to use and that worked perfectly on every car I ever drove suddenly were impossible to control or didn't work at all. The MMI is as dumb and needless as the i-drive.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"                I entirely agree with what you said.  The 18inch wheel on the base car make the 7 look frumpy while the 19inch wheel on the Li make the car look sleek and appealing.  I can't believe 1inch could make that much difference.  So far, 90 percent of the ones I see on the road have the bigger wheels.Don't get me wrong, the car is impressive, but it didn't completely blow me away as I had expected it to.  It was just boring to drive, more like a Lexus than a BMW.  Plus, the i-drive is just too over the top to handle on a daily basis.So far the A8 looks nice, I just wish Audi would have taken the styling a notch further, especially since it has the conservatively styled Phaeton.  As it is now, the car looks too conservative, I would of thought it would look much more Avantissimo-like.  This should be the car that sets the design of Audis for years to come, not look like a bigger A4.The interior seems interesting though.  Time will tell if Audi improved on the i-drive like system they have for controlling the functions of the car.Overall, I don't think that the new A8 will have any more success in the marketplace than the older one.

"                I feel like I'm at an automobile anonymous meeting.  So with that said I would like to say "" I like the way the Bangled 7Series looks, I like the way it drives and I even like idrive( at least the '04 version)!"" Fine there I said it.. Has anyone considered the possibility that people have different tastes and tolerances for new technology.  Most of the posts read like like authoratative reviews yet I suspect few posters on this thread are anything more than well studied but opinionated consumers. I have in the last 6 months driven many luxury sedans including the LexusLS, A8L, 745i, 745iL, RS6, E55, SClass, S55, XJ-8, XJR... I am overwhelmingly convinced that most automotive reviews are biased either by preconceived notions of the reviewers or financial interests of advertising clientele.  The 7Series has gotten a bad rap making it one of the best luxury vehicles to buy or lease right now IMO( which since I am a consumer you can take with a grain of salt).  I can give anecdotes of people trading in their MB's and ls's and loving the new BMW just like anyone else can post the opposite. Each car brand and model have their strengths and weaknesses.  But the fact that so many are trashing the 7Series is great. As a result I've gotten the best buying experience ever in dealing with the 745i.  Way better than I have been treated in Lexus or MB dealerships, past or present.  IMO the LexusLS is utterly and completely boring no matter how reliably it performs.  MB is simple not worth the premium it demands and its numerous buttons are no easier or more reasonable than idrive.  And as long as I'm on the subject of idrive, it can be mastered in a short period of time. It really can, unless taking a few hours with your new vehicle is out of the question. You don't need to be a computer programmer or German.  There are actually a lot of people out there that like idrive.  They're just not posting on this board or complaining.So I don't mind the Lexus lovefest...I'm happy you all are so pleased.  You can even continue the MB vs. Lexus banter. Just keep some objectivity,flexibility, and I dare say humility when it comes to real change and innovation even if in your honest opinions it's seems to be in the wrong direction.

Reliablity for Acura, and styling, and dept of models for Audi.  I heard a few people saying how the A6 and A8s made the Acuras look like a bunch of Hondas, naturally I laughed when I overheard this..lol.    I'm sure Acura took more than their fair share of Audi intenders when the sticker prices were looked at. ljflx, Well thats still a good amount when you're talking about less than 25K cars, especially for such a pricey car to start with.

Honestly I'm tiring of MT, their writing is so high-school and it's always the Corvette, Mustang type rhetoric month in and month out.   No sophistication at all.  England's CAR magazine has more in one issue than about 5 of Motor Trend's.   Though I do like MT's comparos (sometimes) and it's always fun to read what they *think* the future cars are going to be.

Older luxury cars that haven't been maintained like yours are the ones that most people get I guess, because I see a lot more being done on early 90's LS' (second hand) than that.   The Lexus ""experience"" just isn't for me...jstyle, That is the exact same thing I said on the A6 board in the future auto section.  They're doing what BMW used to, cockpit wise. Pablo......your comments on the interior are correct also.  I expected something along the lines of the A8, but they've done a rather generic layout imo.

"                I can guarantee you the 2004 I have now won't rattle in 2007 and the 2007 I will take to replace it won't rattle in 2010. I would be shocked if anything went wrong with either car. That's not luck - it's confidence in phenomenal build quality/reliability. I'm sure there are a handful of bad ones out there but I've never come across anyone that had a bad one. Even when I went to a showroom opening party for the 2001 car and talked to many, many LexusLS owners/lessees at that time I couldn't find one gripe. This car doesn't score those unmistakably high red reliability circles it gets in Consumer Reports year after year on luck. It gets it on know how.Michael - No question the LexusLS is super special. It, the LX and the SCare the elite of Lexus. The GX470 - which I have - is a just miss in that elite circle but it is an excellent SUV nonetheless. The GS430 is a heck of a car but after that I do find the GS300, LexusES and RX more ordinary, particularly the LexusES and the old RX. But the new RX has jumped a lot and is not far from that elite circle. Never drove the IS so I can't say anything about it. The LX is the SUV version of the LexusLS. I could live without the LX, but the lshas me hooked forever unless they screw it up at some point. For me - it's a must have car. I also agree with you on the  SClass - a great luxury car that would be the car I'd be in if Lexus wasn't around. But its poor reliability would drive me nuts.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I can't see Lexus pushing out the old models in a worldwide debut (excep maybe the SC) that touts its new styling direction. So I think you get a 4 vehicle debut because you only get the new designs (and maybe the SC). I also can't imagine Lexus debuting without its flagship sedan. But the existing lsalready sells in Japan as the Toyota Celsior so that's out of the question. So I'd bet the 3 new designs are the IS, GS and ls(as re-designed and fits with CR's report). The 4th vehicle is a mystery. It could be the SC. I think they already have a Toyota version of the RX and the GX so its probably not those. Could be the new LX but its not a volume seller nor is it something to lead with. So is it a new LexusES kept very secret, the old SCor this highly touted $150K sportscar?? Whatever the new modela are they arrive in the US right afterward.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I guess all this gloom and doom is expected on this board, even before the SClass is officially shown.   The car has a terrible interior and exterior, though it is all mucked up for development work.   Yep I too can see what the final car will look like through that mess. lexusguy, Yep, you may have seen too many, but then again the SClass (except for the wheels) looks just like theSClass. ljflx, Yikes a bunch of dealership people from Acura and Ford say that MB is finished, they of course know what they're talking about wouldn't be biased at all. Acura especially.  Mercedes is finished in their eyes yet Acura still doesn't measure up past one car.  Makes sense to me. The group you spoke with should be disqualified immediately from talking about cars if they're still thinking about Audi's unfounded unintended acceleration episode back in what..the 1980s.  Dude they're clueless.  Audi was found to be not at fault!  You're saying this groups sees Lexus as the standard in quality and reliability.  Gasp!  Nobody disputed that and its been harped on every spring for the last 10 years when the surveys are released.  You're right this group aren't enthusiasts, but I'm glad you recognize this.  They think Mercedes is living off their past yet their stuck in the past when thinking about Audi.  The 7Series has excellent quality?  Yet this is the car that this crowd's bible (Consumer Reports) said was more troublesome than a 1996 LexusLS is today in 2004! What a knowledgeable bunch. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"                I guess when I said ""screwed together"" I was also referring to quality.  It's just my ""seat of the pants"" evaluation after having driven these luxury sedans.  To me the Audi still feels a step behind in build quality.  I don't find that ""vault"" like feeling in the A8 that is in the S, lsor 7Series.  It almost feels like ""luxury lite"".The new S is certainly a striking looking ride and if the quality is back to MB standards then it will be a clear winner.  Only issue I have with it besides being out of my comfort zone price wise is the fact that to me it looks like a car that one should be chauffeured in rather than drive themselves.  That's another reason I passed on the A8.  The back was cavernous and I felt very self conscious driving it alone.  As for the looks of the current LexusLS, I for one feel that it has classic, conservative good looks and definitely has a presence on the road.  When I recall the MB's of the late 70s and early 80's which first started to appear as ""status symbols"" in Beverly Hills where I worked, they were also very conservative and not what one would call style leaders (with the exception of the SL).  Their panache and status came from price, relative scarcity and perceived (and real) quality.  Those attributes were then associated with the brand and their styling then became desirable.  I remember they were very much function over form vehicles that were ergonomically superior to the competition and featured a rather ""no nonsense"" interior.  Everything that was there had a purpose and its purpose was accomplished in the most simple and efficient way possible.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"                I had been meaning to ask you what you thought of the facelifted 2005 XK cars?   I really like what they've done to the lower body.  I've seen a coupe in White and a convertible XKR this very rick looking Blue, absolutely stunning.   No arguement about the interior, asthetically it was all Jaguar.  The Germans then were just leather appointed board rooms in which to conduct the ""business"" of driving.   I look for the 2007 XK to vault to the head of this class giving the SClass much to worry about. sv7887l, ""Any thoughts?""Yeah plenty.  Truthfully no Benz has been immune from problems over the last 4-5 years.  The current SClass has been less than stellar also, especially the early build 2003 models.   Some of the SClass owners on the other boards are reporting much better goings with 2004 models.   One poster in particular (Shoes) can tell you all about the current SL, I think he's owned 3 of them now!   The first one he had was not so great, a 2003 model, but his 2004 SL500 has been very good so far, he also had a SL55 AMG if I'm not mistaken. The current SClass (2000) was one of the biggest offenders along with the 2001 C-Class and the omg 1998 ML, which I personally detest.   I'll start with the SClass and the facts:  Mercedes doesn't do ""cheaper"" too well.  The 1992-1999 SClass is the car Mercedes knows how to build and even that car wasn't perfect because they sought to decontent it from 1995 foward, but still it had a build the current S simply doesn't match, it was generally more reliable (read a lot less electronics) than today's S.   The problem was that people complained about it being to expensive, big and heavy so Mercredes responded by making the new car cheaper, lighter, and somewhat smaller (outside), but the quality went way down.   I got a chance to examine one of the last 1999 SClasss next to the 2000 SClasss when they first arrived.  I was truly startled at the compromised they'd made in order to save a few bucks.   Needless to say the body, interior, fittings and finish all went down quite a bit with the 2000 S.   They addressed a lot of these things for the 2003 with the facelift, but it's like to retrofit the quality that should have been there in 2000 and it still doesn't match the LexusLS, A8 or Phaeton in certain area where the old S wouldn't have had a problem doing so.   Hopefully they've learned their lesson and the 2006 S will be built with the traditional quality in mind and less glitches like the current car.   I'll say again though the 2003+SClasses are much better in build quality and reliability from the 2000-2002 models. The ML, and I'll be brief here.   Mercedes sold their soul to the devil of volume.  Instead of build in a true 50-70K truck like they know they wanted to (and can) they built the ML to a price point to compete with a Ford Exploreres and Jeep Grand Cherokees, at 33K in 1998.   The 1998-1999 models were unbelievable cheap inside and out.   I remember it like it was yesterday, me and a salesman looked at each other in disbelief at a ML unveiling at the then Loeber Motors on the near-north side of Chicago.   This this is so freaking cheap!   Needless to say the ML truly showed its colors after the sales boom put them in the hands of traditional MB and new customer alike.  One problem after another, and I don't mean electronics.  I mean fuel leaks, brakes, radiator leaks, differential failures, you name it.  Now 6 years later it places in the top for initial quality.  I don't buy it.   The basic chassis has proven itself in various motorsport events around the world, but everything Mercedes sub'd out was of dubious quality to say the least.   I've never so worried about a new Mercedes in my life as I am the new ML, R and next G, which will all be build in Alabama. The C-Class is basically the same as the S, much improved with it's facelift (2005) in the area of build quality and features too, but the 2001 model was far less then right. Industry analysts have theorized about Mercedes' quality decline and come up with many things.  I think electronics, Chrysler's finanical drain, and more models all led to their quality fall. Remember in 1990 there were only the 190, 300, SClass and SL.   Today there is the SL, CL, S, E, CLK, C, ML, SLK, G, Maybach and more new models (CLS, R) on the way. There are signs that things are improving, especially when a Mercedes is redesigned.  The CLK andEClasses are not being knocked about their interiors like before, thought the new E has had a few initial problems.  Ditto for the SL.  The new SLK and CLS look to have the proper build of a Mercedes.   The upmcoming Bama made vehicles worry me the most. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                i had too many typos in my last message and I apologize for that. I dont see how the RX300 can be called a continuing success if it was selling close to 90K units a few years ago and is selling around 60K now. I don't know what the exact sales figures are but 31% of 200K sales is close to 60K a year. The new one will never hit the sales levels of the first model which was a pioneer.The SRX, X3 and other competition will limit it's success in the market. Listen, I dont have a problem with old people buying cars, that's the media's problem. All I'm saying is that people need to acknowledge that Lexus models other than the IS and RX do not appeal to younger buyers. Now if you live in an area where no one drives anything that isnt an import (CA for example) I can understand why you think all people strive to own a Lexus but that isnt the case here. I have never seen an LexusLS driver with hair that wasnt gray. The old model wasnt much better in that regard but this model seems to be a hit with retirees.If Cadillac was to add 5 or 6K units a month next year it would surpass lexus in sales. Cadillac barely has a price advantage versus the Germans. They have nothing to compete with the 7Series or class but when you look at the prices of other models they arent cheap. The Deville's prce range is $42-58K, Seville $46K-57K, CTS $30K-$40K, escalade $50K-$56K. Next year Cadillac will have a model that is more expensive than any Lexus. We cant dispute who sells more cars but if you look at the average sale price of a CAdillac and a Lexus we know who will have the advantage. Most of Lexus' sales come from three models that cost under $40K and cadillac only has one model that sells for under $40K.Also, I dont think anyone buys a lexus for the looks. Let's be realistic. Out of all the major Luxury makers Lexus has the worst styling. call it subjective if you want to but I never hear anyone that doesnt own a lexus call their cars attractive. The CTS isnt the best looking car but it is conveying a consistent theme which cant be said about any lexus. WHen you see the CTS next to the Slade and XLR it begins to make some sense. I would fix the rear end, but other than that it is a sharp and modern looking car. Lexus has no common design theme and as a result their cars do not match except for their grilles.Cadillac, Infiniti and eventually Lincoln (hopefully) are going to do the same thing in the 2000s that Lexus did in the 90s. They are going to re-establish themselves with new products and performance and someon is going to pay in terms of sales. My guess is that Lexus is going to be the primary casualty.

"                I hadn't heard anything about that.  I did see where they said one of his sons has (or had now) a ""fleet"" of Rolls-Royces.  I guess he won't be ordering a Phantom anytime soon.   Those types of associations with their cars (Lexus or Mercedes) isn't good, but hey the money crowd drives the same car all over the world I guess.   In that country it could have been either.  I see a lot of Toyota Land Crusiers on the news there as well as 80's Mercedes. Now you're right part of the exhilaration that German car fans speak of is a psychological thing. It comes from Mercedes being the first car around and all the times their name has been mentioned with greatness through the years, whether it be racing or innovations.  Believe it or not being priced higher also carries a certain amount of currency with some.  The rest of it is more or less what carnaught said.  Mercedes' have always felt like they track down the road better than the rest, and their high-speed stability is often noted in roadtests, here is where I think Mercedes is better than anyone, including BMW.   The tradeoff is that they won't change direction as quickly as say a BMW will, but BMWs are more nervous (relative) at high speeds. Now the AMG products are even more so.  Car and Driver's review of the new E55 is a testament to that.   Road and Track even picked the old E55 over the current M5 when it came down to high-speed stability.   Now the flipside of that is the here, few people are going to drive as fast so that above 100 mph German ""thing"" is lost on the average BMW, Audi and Mercedes owner.   Porsche owners, well they're slightly different for the most part.   But even with their regular models a  SClass Sport is just tighter than a LexusLS with it's Euro option.   A car like the previous 7Series  Sport was outright sporting for it's class, as is the A8.  I can only imagine how the new 745 Sport models feel on the road with their 19-inch wheels.  The new A8 has gotten sportier too.   The LexusLS is easily the ""softest"" car in this class now.   But I see where you're coming from, if those things are not important you won't see it.

"                I have a pretty good handle on why people buy the Lexus. I certainly do not mean to infer they could not afford theSClass, though in some cases that is true. Witness the poster going from aCClass back to a Lexus LexusLS, I doubt the SClass-600 were real considerations. The value of the LexusLS is undeniable. You acurately describe why many chose the LexusLS. They do not drive in an enviroment where the added capabilities of say and SClass would be noticable or worth the added expense. Dealer service is the best, no dispute there. Beyond that everybody has their own priorities on car buying. I can see/feel/hear the differences in my 750 and 600 vs the LexusLS. I am willing to pay more for the cars to get that advantage.  It is just one of my priorities. I am also going to become a Ferrari owner soon. Not much point in that either, a new Vette has all of the performance. But it lacks some of the feel, heritage and mystique, all things many find foolish, but things I am willing to pay for. I can't fault anyone for buying a Lexus, they just are not for me. It is not for a lack of trying either. I have looked at every new lssince their inception, more than once in all cases. It is just not me. My mother in law still has her '94 SC400, it has 120k miles on it with very few problems and great service from the dealer. She will probably replace it with a RX300, a car I think is a joke. She will not waver from Lexus, and who can blame her. Still the styling and general feel of the cars does not appeal to me at any price.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I dont know anybody with an S, 7, or A8 that didnt have at least one major problem, and I've had zero in 10 years of driving a Lexus LexusLS. The dealer shouldnt give you any trouble about fixing them though. If they do, find another dealer. My wife's RX300 had one or two relatively minor issues, and Rahal took care of them without a problem. Speaking from personal experience, I left M-B for Lexus in '96 because I was tired of the constant repairs, and my Benz was not 14 years old. My current XK is a heck of a lot more reliable than my XJS was, but its still had its share of problems, the supercharger I mentioned before, an airbag warning that took 2 dealer trips to fix, and it also stalled on the highway for no particular reason.

That is, even if their numbers go up, could the LexusES and lssales have gone up further if the GS wasn't redone?

"                I have to agree with you on the driving dynamics of the LexusLS. The car is capable of speeds 100+, but once there it is way too floaty and disconnected to be considered a true autobahn-cruiser. This is even the case with the ""supposed"" Euro-suspension option that includes firmer dampers and bigger wheels. The suspension is just to soggy.The Mercedes S splits the difference. It is firm at high speeds(in which it needs to be) while retaining that good ol' pillowy ride on city streets. I'm coming from an S65 AMG, the king of the S cars, and even it was compliant enough for daily operations. Mercedes is one of the best when it comes to suspension tuning. I sold the S65 for an Audi A8 W-12 and it too has the ""german"" suspenion. Bimmers, Mercedes, and Audi's are built to stay glued to the road.I feel your SClass will be so great that you'll all but forget about the LexusLS, especially in the fun-to-drive department.

""Faster, more beautiful, very comfortable for the class, Hi-Tech rich, better ride, more room, a very usable trunk that would take a set or two of golf clubs and still have a little room left for luggage.""Wrong on all counts!   The Allante was not faster than the 500SL, only the 300SL, and I won't even mention the 1993 V12 600SL which would hand the Allante its lug nuts. The Allante was ""high-tech""?  Please tell me what was high-tech about it.  Please don't tell me about gauges and the car saying ""good morning"" when you started it up.  Yeah I know about that stuff. I know what it didn't have (to name a few things): The 1990 SClass had a completely automatic top, only a button push was needed. The 1990 SClass had the world's first completely automatic rollover protection. The 1990 SClass (300SL) had the worlds first 5-speed automatic transmission, this was in 1990! All 1990 SClass models had vastly superior engines to any Allante.  The Allante only got an competitive engine in 1993 which was it's 8th and last year on the market.  Typical GM move. The Allante had a better ride?  I've never seen that published anywhere and if it did, it surely didn't handle like the rwd SClass did. Styling is everybody's own thing so I can't tell you which looked better to you.  I thought the Allante did have a unique look for a Cadillac at the time, but it didn't age nearly as well as the SClass from those years, imo. Nobody thinks anything here, the Allante didn't compare to the SL.  This is an industry-wide opinion.   Everything about the 1990-2002 was superior to the Allante.  The 1990 SClass was a Mercedes' Mercedes.  This car debuted many of the tech features every luxury car uses today, especially luxury convertibles. Saying the Allante was superior to the 1990 SClass is like saying the 1990 DeVille was superior to the 1990 LexusLS!  Something I'm not understanding here if you're used to Lexus quality.

"                I have to for once agree with your entire post. MB stands to gain some fierce American(market) competition. Lexus is on a upswing with it's halo LexusLS. Audi will be on a warpath over the next 5 years with highly anticipated release of the discount-Lambo R8 coupe, with it's 3 different powertrains. Then they'll attack the compact segment by giving the upcoming A4 a more RWD-biased drive, altho it will remain AWD, which will be standard now.Then with the release of the cool Q7, comes a X3-fightin' Q5. But the real whopper will be the new for '09 A8. We're said to get both standard and L wheelbases to compete with Lexus(as in current cars). And the V-8 engine will remain 4.2L, BUT, will get a rocketship of a boost to the tune of over ""450hp"" standard, with the W-12 going to 550-hp, and a S8 with reportedly over ""600hp""(surely a direct hit to AMG and the much-rumored M7 of the next-gen 7Series) in a V-10 that is to grow to 5.4L from the next-gen Gallardo. But we do know that there will be a V-10 TDI that'll be 50-state compliant by then also, with possibly a hybrid-diesel in cahoots with partner Porsche in exchange for freebies on DSG.Yes Audi(specifically A8) is a premiere brand in it's homeland and abroad. It's accepted globally, except in the USA. But Audi is long tired of not having enough presence in the HELM market of America. Sure it sells like crazy elsewhere(some markets the top seller, including Germany and now Jordan of all places), but there is no other country(besides Dubai of course) that has a cachet of customers that are willing to buy cars at extraordinary prices. We also don't have the ""duties"" or outrageous ""rich taxes"" tacked on to the bottom line of our cars. Sales and luxury taxes are quite enough. Audi will reportedly spend over 1 billion dollars in US advertising and marketing to ensure that slow selling-good cars like the A8 won't sit idle this go'round. We'll see.

"                I have to respond to your quote:""...Lexus appears to appeal to the same conservative geriatric crowd (thus explaining its uninspired styling) that Cadillac aspires to. Lexus has substantial brand loyalty and that's why most of the trade-ins are from previous Lexus owners. It seems to me that the people who are attracted to Cadillac would also be attracted to the Lexus.""As I said, I'm more in  EClass  / 5Series / GS buyer category.  But for you to make that claim is particularly funny to me.  You make it sound like Mercedes is some ""hip"" company and Lexus should diversify into the funeral parlor business. May I point out, Mercedes offers noEClass or above, or AMG cars with a manual transmission to compete with BMW.  A E55 6-speed would have great appeal to me, but alas, only the M5 will allow me that option.  The $50k+ SLK32 is a cure for insomnia compared to the driving dynamics of my $32k S2000.  In my car shopping experiences, I have consistently been told by Mercedes dealers that ""we tend to appeal to an older, more conservative demographic, especially here in America"".  I'm in my late 40's and a Republican.  Who the hell are they talking about?If you think driving an SClass instead of an lsmakes you feel younger, by all means go for it.  But your position about the age/appeal issue is pretty funny from my perspective.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                i have yet to read a post where anyone has called the LexusLS ""unsafe"".  what i have readis posters pointing out the different philosophies between Lexus and MB when it comes to safety.  i certainly would prefer to be in a LexusLS than many other cars in the event of a crash but if given the choice between the lsand the S i would without any reservation prefer the S.  maybe someone can lend some light on this.  when an automaker pioneers a new safety technology it seems to me that they might patent the technology but yet allow other automakers to use it.  does anyone know how this process works?hpowders....if your still on the fence and you haven't already give the A8 swb a test drive. sporty, safe, and comfortable all at the same time!

"                I don't think you looked hard enough if you couldn't find any posts on the SClass board in which some passed on the LexusLS dues to two main things, styling and it's completely isolating character.  I see more than a few references to Buicks when talking about Lexuses, especially when talking about the LexusLS and ES300.   Even C&D said that about the SC430.   Now before you say it, I'm not saying they're Buicks.  You're right I haven't driven the LexusLS, but answer me this has it truly become any more involving from the previous 1995-2000 model?  I've driven that model more than a few times and I haven't seen anywhere that the LexusLS has become so much sportier relative to the previous model.  I'll ask you this just like I asked wishinhigh, why compare the LexusLS to the SClass since the price difference is so great, what makes the SC430 vs SL500 debate so different from theSClass/ SClass vs LexusLS debate?M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I haven't read anything on any price increases on  EClass , despite the mild refreshening and the use of the 5.5L V-8 in the E550. The E63 is said to increase only nominally so. No biggie for arguably my favorite mid-size luxury, the super E55/upcoming E63(used to be the RS 6 before Audi pulled the plug on it, but the Euro's are still enjoying the M5 beating beast on the new A6 platform). Can't wait to drive the car as the E55 scared the living daylights out of me.(Hope they've dialed down ESP and dialed UP ABC and reworked Airmatic and brakes, like the CLS's system)As for the diesels, I've talked with my Jeep rep and he has confirmed to me that they will sell a variant of the Bluetec in the JGC and Commander, and possibly the Liberty, for the '08 model year. And they will get MB's 7-Gtronic tranny as the new engine is ""supposedly"" built around it, unlike that of the outgoing 3.2 CDI, which remains with MB's 5-speed Auto. So what does this means for MB? Judging from past marketing strategies, I don't think they'll let the Jeep come to market before the MB's are released. Maybe in unison, but not before. And I also here that Audi will encroach on the growing NA diesel market with release of their super clean(same technology as used on Bluetec, super-high capacity particulate and soot trap with only water vapor to exit the exhaust pipe) 3.0L V-6 TD that the Europeans have been boasting about since it's inception in '04. Hopefully the both of them will stick to the game plan.As to the S65's pricing, I read in Autocar that the S65 won't stray far from it's '06 pricing, meaning about 170k. Then I heard to expect a price of about 173-175k, not too far off the mark. The newSClass' price hasn't increased drastically, so I don't think the car would be priced to far off the mark. The S63 isn't that far off the S55's mark. The only S to be priced drastically higher(so to speak) is theSClass, but that's because they wanted the flagship model to have every possible option standard, except of course the eventual interior upgrades.I wondered too why the M and R aren't getting the new V8's for '07. The only new V-8 going in the M is the 6.2L for the ML63. But I've heard talks of the 4.7L out of the GL to be offered in the ML, to be priced 3-4 grand less than the bigger V-8.

"                I haven't taken the time, or maybe had the willingness, to pore over the TMV versus testimonials of the many brands as of yet, but it would be interesting I'm sure.  One thing I have learned about people is, they love to brag about how much they spent on their house, and how little they spent on their car.  The people who end up feeling like they left money on the table after taking delivery, don't tend to want to go out and tell their story.  So the results of these testimonials MAY be a bit one-sided.       Also, depending on the time of a model cycle in the year, the factory may have dealer cash on a car that in some cases steeply effects the sale price.  If I have a couple of grand back on a car, I will tell you about it.  and we don't keep ANY cars in green or bordeaux red, or any of those off colors, all you get there is a car you have to sell at cost.  It's sad to see a beautiful design painted with a hideous color.  BMW's recent designs especially only look good in certain colors, IMO.       -also, to who ever posted it, I never meant to infer that the only, or even main, reason the lssells better than theSClass, is price.  But I do believe it is a factor, although I won't put any more energy into arguing over how significant of one it is.  The lsis very likely the most sensible full size luxury car on the market today, and it will appeal to most of the market, but I will maintain that not every one in that market is going to go for it.

"                I fully expect the next gen lswill be a 2007 model and will be available in Oct 2006 - at the latest. My sales guy told me I'm on the perfect 3 year plan right now for always getting the latest significant changes. But Lexus is getting aggressive in their roll-out plans for this new LFS design and I think they just want to get it over with for the LexusLS,IS and LexusES ASAP. Toyota's financial resources are sky high right now so they can do almost any aggressive move they want to. So I would not be surprised if the new lsis available as early as the Spring of 2006 as a 2007 model. I don't think they want the SClass to have a one year lead anymore and with BMW shooting themselves in the foot this is becoming an lsvs S battle in the long run. The Maserati won't cut it here in my opinion and whatever it does will likely hurt BMW and Jaguar.Speaking oof Jaguar - a business acquaintence had to have his transmission replaced in the fall. After a lot of negotiations with Jaguar they cut him a deal that allowed him to only pay for the labor (about $1200) as the car was about a year past warranty. This was a classy act by Jaguar as the transmission cost over $9k. But he only had 30k miles on the car. Now the car died on him again and is in the shop for 10 days. His comment to me last week was ""I never had a problem with a Jaguar until I bought one"". He's had numerous minor problems before but now he is flat out disgusted.

"                I hope after seeing the recepetion to the R-class, BMW decides the ""luxury minivan"" is not a hot new segment begging for more entries, and cans the R-class fighter they are working on.I'm not sure that Lexus SUV sales are going to take that much of a hit. The 400h should help boost RX sales, and the GX is really not that old, it was brand new for '03, no older than FX, and much newer than the comparatively ancient Acura MDX. They wont sell many LX470s, but they've never sold many LX470s. '07 will bring brand new versions of both of Lexus' biggest selling cars, and they should have a very good year.For Audi's sake, I hope they are able to save the Q7 from the curse of Toureg that is giving Toureg and Cayenne reliability scores that make Land Rover look great. The A6 isnt getting a new V6 any time soon, and definitely not the Passat's VR6. It faces the wrong way.Infiniti is showing the ""concept coupe"" which is basically the next G35 coupe, so I dont think that the next G is that far away. I think it will definitely be a '07 model, just not sure when its going to show up.I think the XK is going to do well, but as you said, it cant save the company. They basically already need a brand new XJ, even though the current version is just 2 years old. The new Benz S and the LS460 are just going to slaughter it. Whats worse, considering how long the last XJ6\8 and XK ran, the XJ will additionally have to deal with a brand new 7Series, and at least an updated A8 before it even gets a refresh, let alone a redesign.Pushing Jag up into the ""new Bentley"" space of $150K products seems like the only place to go, as there's just no way they can compete in the volume luxury arena. If\when they get there though, I dont think Ford will be the owner any more. Ford just doesnt have the scratch to fund that kind of a transition, which could take a decade.The interiors for all of the new GM full-size trucks, even the Chevy Tahoe, are really impressive. Not quite as good as the latest Toyota interiors, but better than just about every one else in the segment. I never thought I'd say that about a GM product. Cadillac needs a new CTS though, and quick.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"                I just got the issue tonight.   I haven't read the entire article, but I did see where they said that a8 is the better choice for most luxury car buyers.  I agree with that assessment.  The Maserati doesn't have the proper transmission to be daily-duty luxury car.   I just like the fact that there is such a chic alternative in the class.    As others have stated, Audi has an image problem in the country.  The unintended acceleration problem isn't on too many people's minds today, but I'm sure it hasn't been completely forgotten.  When I think of the idiots behind that it makes me sick.  It's funny how none of those cases ever showed a defect with the car.   Audi was guilty of placing the pedals in their manual transmission cars too close together for fat American's feet.  You know heel and toe style. Anyway, it's pretty much Pablo stated, people just don't think as high of Audi as they do BMW and MB in this country.  Their associate with VW doesn't help either, plus the reliability concerns all conspire to keep Audi below BMW and MB when it comes to the A8.  Believe it or not even Audi's really hot cars like the RS6 sell out like E55s and M5s do.   The dealer here has 3 of them, and has had them for a while now.  The E55 moves much faster and the new M5 will be all but unobtainable this fall/winter.   Audi just doesn't have the draw with the rich like BMW, and they're even further away from Mercedes-Benz.   Mercedes can just about sell whatever they put a star on, not even BMW (Z8, 760Li are examples) can so easily do this. However the A8 just had its best sales year ever in this country, a whopping 4K cars!!  With a new W12 model coming this fall, and a rumor short wheelbase model also arriving at the same time, they might be able to move 5K a year.  Still only half of what the XJ does, and about 1/4 of what the S, lsand 7Series do. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I just prefer the refinement of the SClass over every other luxury car except the LexusLS. I'm sure technically the updated Audi has better features and certainly a better interior. But the driving feel of the SClass (and I really mean the  SClass here as I would not buy the lesser poweredSClass) and the LexusLS are very much alike and the best of the group for my preferences. I didn't like the Audi ride one bit. It's just too harsh for a lux car and it was on 18"" tires. But looks-wise the A8 is the class winner to me.merc1 - both the S and the 7 are being discounted like never before. In my area an LexusLS ultra will price out about the same or slightly cheaper than a $77K S or 7 after the discounts are taken into consideration and be more expensive on lease. The more traditional $62-65K ls's will still be noticably less in purchase price but are very close on lease due  to the combo of subsidized interest rates and higher residuals on the LexusLS. However you want to look at it the ""real' prices being paid are the narrowest ever and the LexusLS sales are nearly double of the S or 7.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm sure one of those reasons is price.  the A8 is more expensive and also is only available with awd.  another nice quality about the A8 is the ability to purchase the car in a long wheel base version or short.  plus....what's more advanced than an automobile made completely of aluminum?  right now the demand for the A8 is pretty strong.  better discounts are available on the lsby far.  take a look at what options are available in an A8, S, or 7.  take a good hard look.  these are upscale luxury cars.  the LexusLS is just not in the same league.  nice car but not enough of it.  but...i do think Lexus will within 10 years produce a vehicle that is comparable.   ?as for the SClass being king....what i was trying to convey is that the SClass dominates in its segment.  i was excluding the brands that sell at price points starting above 150k.

Having said that, I just spent some time in a new A8L, and was very impressed (maybe I just need a change, I'm driving an '01 ls), but I'm still concerned with reliability and service.

"                I just read your question about electronics and yes I think Mercedes and BMW especially have gone far enough with this.   One thing thats driving this techo war is the fact that every maker in the true luxury class of cars is making a better product and it's getting harder to stand out above the crowd.   Some do it by styling/horsepower/innovations (Mercedes and to a lesser extent Jaguar), others do it by sheer quality and refinement (Lexus) and others do it by handling prowess and providing a more stimulating driving experience (BMW)...and then you have Audi that aims to provide all of the above in one dynamic package in the A8. The side show to all of this is the hp war between the German automakers.   Your concerns have been heard by Mercedes-Benz of all companies.  In a recent article in Automobile Magazine and Britian's CAR Magazine, its reported that Mercedes has decided NOT to go ahead with even more complex things like automatic lane correction, among other almost unbelievable things.  They (Mercedes) thank god, have also decided not to try and match BMW's idrive concept.  The next Comand system is to be designed by Nokia, instead of their current supplier...it should be much simpler to use and more reliable. BMW has obviously heard the complaints too, as the 5Series' idrive controller is reported to be much simpler.  Audi got wind of the whole thing much earlier and made the A8's MMI system much easier to use than BMW's idrive or Mercedes' Comand setup. I'm anxious to drive the new 5Series with it's new electronic variable-ratio steering rack though, in theory it sounds perfect, but the press will tear it apart if it lacks that all important ""feel"" that a BMW's steering is supposed to have.

"                I guess it all depends on what Lexus meant when they said ""5 fighter"".  If they meant they wanted to challenge the 5 in terms of sport alone, some people might consider it a failure.  If they meant that they wanted to steal sales from the 5, then the verdict is not in, yet, but it looks promising.  I wonder, though, if Lexus won't end up cannibalizing some of its own sales of the lsand LexusES.Personally, I like the GS.  It looks much better in real life than in pictures.  I happen to think the Infiniti M looks better, though, and that is MHO.  While others may disagree, the 5 looks fabulous and still turns my head (I like the controversial look of the 7, too).The really interesting thing will be to see year-over-year sales one year from now.  While the Infiniti can't be compared as it is a completely new vehicle (although as a percentage increase in sales, this would make it the hands-down winner).            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I just wanted to chime in with my great experience with my '06 XJ Super V8.  I am not a die hard Jaguar fan, have not dreamed about owning a Jag all my life.  I did not intend to buy a Jaguar this time around.  But having done so, I am really happy.  Here is my story.I had owned a two Cadillac Eldorado STS from 1995 through 2000.  I enjoyed the sporty response and rapid acceleration.  But when they announced that the model would be discontinued, I decided it would be a good time to step up in the world.  At that time, the updated Lexus LexusLS was introduced and it fit my budget.  I owned it from 2001 through 2005.  I had 68,000 problem-free, quiet, comfortable, mind-numbingly boring miles.  It could go fairly fast, and with the ""European Sport Package"" could take corners fairly well, but it really didn't want to go fast or corner hard. As the lease came to an end, I resolved to get something more engaging.  (Yes, a lease with 68,000 miles--what was I thinking?)I test drove everything that was supposed to be a sporty sedan.  (The wife required that it be a sedan.)  I drove everything except the BMW 7Series because it is still not good looking and no one I know has mastered the I-Drive.  I was especially looking forward to the Audi A8 because all the car magazines rave about it, and my wife had once owned a 2001 Audi A4 3.0 with quattro, and it was SO fun to drive.  I was expecting a A4 with legroom.  Nope.  Ponderous feeling.  Noticeably not quick. And after the Lexus, unacceptable cabin noise.Drove the '07 MB  SClass (a few were around the town available to drive).  The best Lexus Mercedes ever made.  Certainly much faster and better mannered than any MB I have driven before.  (I have never been an MB fan.)  Also nice looking, inside and out.  But it just felt heavy and uninvolving.  Other than the speed, it was difficult to see why I would pay $25,000 more than for a new Lexus.  (And this was just before Lexus announced the new LS460.)  I also tried a CLS55, which was extremely fast although it always felt as though it was working hard.  The ride was not that punishing on the behind.  But while the interior fit and finish looked nice, it somehow felt down-market.  And it truly is a 4 door coupe.  I doubted my wife would consider it a sedan.  The Maserati Quattroporte made me smile so much.  I even found a way to snag three test drives!  But each time after the adrenaline wore off, I couldn't help but wonder about reliability, fuel costs, insurance costs, repair costs and availability of qualified mechanics.  And it is pricy.  I sure hope Maserati can match others' reliability in the long run.  This is car that deserves to be in the market. So I was forced to drive a Jaguar.  (I literally didn't want to because when the new aluminum model came out a few years ago I had sat in one and couldn't find a comfortable seat position.)  I drove a JX8.  It was nice.  The dealer wanted me to try a XJR.  I declined because I assumed it would be rougher riding than I had become used to.  He talked me into trying a Super V8.  Golly, it made me smile.  Literally.  Stupid fast, willing to run at the slightest provocation, so light and responsive.  Quiet even when risking tickets for unlawful exhibition of speed.  Smooth ride.  And the extra seat buttons on the Super V8 got me into a comfortable driving position.  So this is what Jaguar fans have been talking about all these years?  I'm joining.  I have had the car for 8 weeks and have 2,000 miles on it.  No problems, mechanically, but did get one speeding ticket.  I'm being careful now.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I knew I was right about 2 things, the SUV ""what if"" and the BMW X3 and 1Series.    BMW's new models will fail because they can't be allowed to add to BMWs sales totals, thus giving them a chance to pass Lexus.    That said, you know how I feel about SUVs, so the X3 is of no mention, but you're forgetting that SUVs are as hot as nickel beer and the X3 I'm betting will sell like such.  How can you say the 1Series will fail when nobody even knows anything official about the car yet, other than speculation.  Here is what seperates the thinking in here.  Lexus is about luxury first, combined with great stereos and nav systems, all wrapped in leather and wood.  Thats the way most Lexus fans will look at every automobile, but that isn't the only formula that works, obviously.  BMW is about driving first and foremost.  If the 1Series is constructed of quality materials like all other BMWs and provides that driving feel and performs like a BMW should, the car will be a hit because it will open the doors of BMW ownership to a whole new group of less-monied drivers. Lexus supporters always say that Lexus has no intentions of offering a car for less than 30K, but the reality of it is that they can't because of already fairly luxurious Toyota models like the Avalon and Camry XLE V6, both of which already crowd around the ES330's base price.  Saying they don't intend to isn't as true as saying they really can't. Now for the SUV ""what if"" component.  I knew it would be deemed ""silly"" amoung other things.  I, after freely admitting that the ML is no competiton for Lexus' clear-cut dominance of the luxury suv market, merely suggested that if Mercedes had 3 SUVs that were of worth competition that they might sell much better than the (no contest) ML does.  ljflx, as far as Mercedes competiting with the RX300, the ML was actually first to the market, but they misjudged what the next trend would be, which as you state correctly is a car-based, tall car like vehicle now dubbed the ""crossover"".   The ML is built like a tradition SUV where the RX is built more like a car, and the RX concept is what is preferred, no arguement from me there.   Where you are wrong is the assumption that Mercedes doesn't have a decent car platform to build a RX like vehicle from.  The C orEClass chassis would be perfect for this, but what do you expect them to do, dump the ML, close down a new factory and redesign a new vehicle while throwing all the billions used for developing the ML down the drain?  I know you understand that it takes time and money to react to a changing market.   The upcoming R-Class (GST) is Mercedes entry into the crossover segment, though at a higher position than the RX.  The ML is also switching to a car-based platform for 2005, while I doubt it will be as soft as the  RX .  Yes Mercedes, like everyone else didn't see the RX success coming, score one for Lexus. syswei, Like all the other sales theories cast so far in here, you're ignoring price.  There is no way a 90K G55 is going to every sell in any significant numbers.  Lets stay current also, there is no ML55.  Yes Mercedes has more car lines than Lexus, but when are you going to look at the sticker prices for all those Mercedes models you're citing as being a selling advantage over Mercedes.   Doesn't the IS/ES compete with the C-Class, the GS with the E, the lswith the S, the SCwith the CLK and to a lesser extent the SL?  If so then that leaves the SLK and the CL as the models that Lexus truly has no answer for.    At least a half-dozen ""variants"" of some of the MB models you listed sell for over 100K, yet you're citing them advantages when it comes to sales, come on now, do you really think a CL55, SL600 or even the E55 is the reason why Mercedes sells more cars.   One minute AMG sales are the most insignificant sales numbers on the market, now they are implied to be a big reason as to why Mercedes actually sells more cars. Ultimately,  Mercedes having more cars is easily balanced out by Lexus' cars costing thousands and thousands less.I don't have to look at all the cars Mercedes has to prove my point.  When you look at the E320 and the E500 vs the GS300 and GS430, the E wins in sales, quite easliy.  Forget the E55 and the E320 wagon, the former a small volume car, and the latter just having gone on sale.  The E does over 5K cars a month, take away 1500 of those (even if they wagon and E55 sold that many, and they surely don't) the E still outsells the GS easily, and does so a much higher price. The SClass is the same way, it sells just as well or better than the lsdoes (its really a up/down thing here), and theSClassand SClass models only account for maybe 150 cars a month in a good month. Using the prevailing logic in here, the amount of cars Lexus sales says they're cars are just as below-snuff Mercedes SUVs are considering how Lexus' cars sells compared to always more expensive Mercedes cars.   To look at, and use sales numbers as the sole basis for coming to such a conclusion is plum-ridiculous, but that is what was implied about Mercedes yesterday on this very board, while not even looking any other facts. You totally missed the SUV ""what if"".  It went like this, what if Mercedes had 3 SUVs priced like and just as capable as Lexus'.  I already know that the ML and G don't compare, you're only proving my point about Lexus' sales lead being based on SUVs.   My point for bringing all this up is that you and others are not looking at the total picture when drawing all these uninformed conclusions about the demise of Mercedes-Benz, based on sales data. You're right we don't have to deal in what if type reasoning, and I almost never do, only did so because of the rampant speculation going on, but you're not dealing in ALL the facts about the REAL market either. Aren't you the one that said over and over that the SC430 doesn't compete with the SL500, XK8, 911 and the like because of it's price?  Yet you're ignoring this very same thing when it comes to sales, pretending it has nothing to do it. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I know all about car fanatics... Especially in LA.. Cars are like status badges to many people. They define themselves by their vehicles. By the way, I did see a 2002 Q45 on the street this morning, and it looked pretty cool.  As it approached the intersection across from me, the headlights and front end looked pretty awesome. I also must qualify myself, by admitting that I really disliked the front end of this car when I first saw it at the auto show.  I now think that it is a distinctive look, and it is not going to be mistaken for any other car. By contrast I think that the LexusLS looks like the last generation of the MercedesSClass, after a careful cross-breeding experiment with a Toyota Avalon. I am not saying that it is an ugly car. However, it is just nothing special from the exterior.  Once you put in the upgraded Mark Levinson sound system (to compete with the Infiniti's standard system) and sunroof packages, a relatively basic LexusLS ends up being at least 10k more than the Infiniti Q45. (and, I am not even talking about either car outfitted with navigation).  Edmunds seems to be saying the same thing in their recently posted Road Test of the LexusLS, by suggesting that Lexus LexusLS buyers might also consider the Q45 for less money. I am not the rooting section for Infiniti. We already have some of their cheerleaders here.  I am just a car fan and prospective luxury car buyer.   So, can't we all just agree that Infiniti has re-entered this rarified market of fine cars with the new Q45.   Even our ""devil's advocates"" like ripnrocket seem to concede that much.... So, lets move on!            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I have owned theSClass,740il,ES300 and SC300. Never owned the LexusLS, but my Lexus experience was not as rosy as yours. True, the S and 7 have electrical problems,and moreso the 7. True, the 7 is the best handling and sportier of these cars. True, for bragging rights, one should by the SClass over the 7 and LexusLS. But reliablity and customer service in my Lexus experience was not  at that good. LexusES had seat memory problems, and the a/c shunk like hell after about 3 months of ownership. After about 6 additional months of bad service and Lexus refusing to fix the a/c, I sold the car for a major loss. My SC300's only major problem was condensation in the headlights. I had a wreck in the car and they could not fix is right. The transmission was messed up after that. Some times it would take me a couple of minutes to get the car in reverse. I didn't want to deal with Lexus not handling errors well again so I got rid of the car.Lexus for the most part is more reliable than the others.  The way they handled their errors was not acceptable though. The best customer service I've had has been from Mercedes and Jaguar(which I own presently:Vanden Plas and XK8). The Jags have been fairly reliable to.You make good points about the cars and why you chose the Lexus. Makes sense. Most people who buy luxury cars though, are not thinking reliablity first. They are thinking prestige first. A short (2 to 3 year) lease handles the reliability issue for the most part. Although I enjoyed driving the Lexus products, they're notSClass, 7Series l or Jaguar. Prestige and heritage. People still look for these intangibles in automobiles. My Lexus experience was horrible, but most people seem to have good experiences. Logically, the Lexus should be the no.1 choice, if you exclude prestige and heritage.For all of us who send 60k plus on a car, we're  burning money. Reliability can be had with an Accord or Camry at 20k. We really want the prestige that goes with driving an LexusLS, S, 7 or Jag. Excluding my experience, if I was going to buy one of these cars to keep for the long run, the Lexus is the choice, hands down in engineering.Basically, all I am saying is that they all have major shortcomings. I would advice anyone to buy what the like, period. They all have disappointed me in some way, but I will probably always own a luxury car. Good luck with the LexusLS.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"                I know what you meant, just poking at you a bit. I agree, even the upgraded systems in the new Porsches are a joke. They apply technology to other priorities like power and handling, Germanic priorities, that is why I have one!I also have test driven all of these cars and then some. Our first foray into luxo cars was a '95 7Series L, not without its problems, but gorgeous to look at and splendid to drive. I looked at the LexusLS (used) and the new LexusLS. I drove both, in the same weekend I drove the 740,750,S430, SClass and A8. I am impressed by the Lexus for quality, smoothness and service reputation. It's no secret that I prefer the M-B and BMW. The one that surprised me was the A8, very well equipped and the nicest interior of the bunch. The reputation of questionable quality kept me away, along with the prospect of repairing a damaged aluminum bodied car. I also would challenge the Lexus fans to take out the M-B and BMW for aggressive drives, this will reveal with no uncertainty the advantages of the German designs. The Lexus may be quiet, well equipped, and reliable, but it simply does not drive like a BMW. Like before I think it comes down to prorities, I like a responsive, virile machine, if I want to relax I use the couch in my living room. I also think it is foolish to suggest that M-B and BMW are in trouble financially and may not be able to compete. That is awfully far fetched, and certainly premature. Niether is floundering or lacking direction, they are the leaders, the innovaters, I have no doubt they will survive and flourish.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                i know.  of all people, i happened to marry a woman who has absolutely no interest whatsoever in cars.  (she always gets the new GX confused with the ML500, or the new Accord coupe with my SL.  i am not joking at all).  i had to fool (or trick) her into getting the Lexus on our anniversary by going to the dealership, asking to drive a demo GX, and at the end, i arranged the manager to offer my wife to bring it home for the weekend.  when she bluntly said ""no"", he said ""too bad, here's the keys.  it's yours.""  (she was so attached to her Mercedes ML that seconds later, she was crying at the Lexus dealership, and everyone was staring at us)is Audi really that bad?  i guess seeing can be deceiving.  i was truly impressed by the overall fit-in-finish of the A8L, TT, allroad...i knew that the older models of audi suffered significant reliability issues, but i thought that audi changed. my daughter's audi TT is working beautifully for her.  i guess not.300Eguy05:i am planning on trading in the SClass anytime now if i can get a good deal on a new good car.  i used to own a '89 300E 2.6 Black Pearl metallic that was truly dear to me (actually my wife).  that was my favorite MB that i ever purchased.  it never failed her for the 10 year that we owned it, and boy, you should have seen her the day we traded it in for the ML320 (i thought our 14-year old family dog died).  it had 100,000 miles on it when the mileage ticker stopped working, so i estimate that it had about 115,000 miles when we sold it.i am trying to find more pictures of the official refresh for the 2004 7Series.  so far, based on what i have seen, i am not impressed.  i actually think that the front headlamps do not look as dramatic as before; i liked the ""eagle-like"" look of the original headlamps more.  the rear looks just the same.  i don't know if the sources i went to were lousy, though.my SClass is in the body shop right now.  i was informed that it would take a little over a month for new parts to come in.  i told them to go a good job this time, as last time when my SClass was hit in the rear again, it took 2 months, and the entire lining of the trunk was loose, and a loud metal-against-metal sound could be heard in the rear seats.  they have been unable to find the ""noise"" at the back.I am also considering replacing the radio antannae.  i don't know about other fellow 2000-2003 SClass owners, but the FM, particularily AM reception stinks.  all i really hear is static. the dealership (i have complained constantly to MB USA, and the dealership itself) apparently does not know what is wrong.  they said the sameting when my gas gauge fluctuated between FULL and 1/4 within 2 minutes.  they took out the entire dashboard, rear gas tank sensor, and all i know is that it still moves up and down (though not as badly), and as a result, there are more rattling noises BOTH near the instrument cluster and behind the rear headrests.

"                I like the way this is all turning out.No matter what has been said, we should all agree that the new S is a success in terms of engineering, style, and performance.  For the most part, it has received rave reviews across the board.  Sales seem very good out of the gate and a little more time will confirm all that even more, I'm sure.In addition, we should all agree that based upon all the early data, the new lsis likely an improved animal in all respects.  There has been little speculation, comparitively, about how the S and lswill most likely affect BMW.  Most of the discussions have been about the upcoming head-to-head battle between the S and the LexusLS.  It is understandable.  It feels like we've all got front-row tickets to an upcoming Vegas heavyweight championship fight.  It's exciting, and many of us are already placing our bets.Again, BMW is lurking also, but I wonder where the balance between Lexus, Mercedes, and BMW would be.  BMW seems to be more of a 3Series and 5Series company to me.  I don't know if others agree with that, but I do see it that way.  Will BMW have an adequate competitor against the latest S and the upcoming LS?Audi's improvements are amazing, but sales are not playing in the majors when compared to the others.So, it will be the biggest battle EVER between the S and the LexusLS.  I think it is fair to say that at this point the S is the current champion to beat, and the new lschallenger looks to be in the best shape ever seen.From a personal perspective, my friends know me to be a Eurocar guy . . . they have always been my favorites . . . but this new LexusLS. . . to be fair . . . looks sweet . . . especially the LS600hL.TagMan            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I live here, not Europe, so I couldn't give a damm about Europe. My comments are about America - a place where Audi is an afterthought. This is not an opinion - it's a quantifiable fact - just look at the sales numbers of the brand and the historically low volume of A8 sales. The car is not on anyone's radar screen new or used. I actually loved the A8 styling (before that ridiculous grille was put on it) and also liked very much the old A8 styling. But everytime I drove the A8 - new and old - it was a fairly harsh ride and I didn't find the handling all that nimble particularly given the sacrifice in ride. Secondly, if The ls600H prices in the $90K range, then in that class of price it's the king in HP. 430HP being equivalent to a 4 cyl in this class is yet another comment of yours that is biased and looks like a joke.

But a little more research did show that the Audi A6 was not far off the mark of the winning Infiniti M.And OAC, I'm not hatin'(as kids say these days) on Lexus. If you'd re-read some of my earlier posts form this month I repeatedly praised the company for their newly found energy at being more competitive, especially in light of what's coming out of Europe and Toyota's own Japanese rival, Nissan/Infiniti. And the new LexusLS, with it's body-heat sensing auto temp control, first-ever use of LED headlights(supposed to last the lifetime of the car, and of course the 600h, the company has hopefully become full circle. And if the lsgets better suspenders this go-round, then we all might be talking a different tune.BTW: If Lexus wants to get really serious, dump the frumpy SCand build the LF-A. With V-10 power and over 500-hp, it'll be a very welcome entry to the company. The Infiniti Skyline GTR should be a nice competitor, as well as the upcoming Audi R8 and Bimmer M6.

Another article from Automotive News says that Toyota wants to revamp the entire Lexus lineup when Lexus is launched in Japan in August 2005 with L-Finesse-designed cars that have no visual links to Toyotas. Any further push into Europe will be delayed until the Japan launch of the new cars.In an interesting twist of irony, Lexus does not want to sell any North American Lexuses as rebadged Lexuses in Japan (that's why the current Lexuses were not on display at the Tokyo Auto Show, only the two L-Finesse cars). In other words, the  RX  will not all of a sudden become a Lexus in Japan in 2005. Again, they say they want a whole new lineup designed from scratch.My guess is the RX, LexusES, LX, etc. will stay as North American Lexuses only until they're redesigned. At that time they'll get the L-Finesse treatment and be sold in North America, Japan and Europe. I wonder if that means names like Celsior, Aristo, etc. would be dropped when the new L-Finesse replacements come. We'll have to wait and see.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I neglected to state the venerable Explorer's sales, which at one point topped 500,000 in 2000 despite the Firestone ""pandemic"":P. With all these best-sellers, where is the $$$ going? The once profitable Ford put money back in the pot to create vehicles such as the Explorer and to bail out suffering automakers(ie: Jaguar(1989) and Mazda). With it's colossal force in both mainstream and upscale cars, one would think that the company would be at the top of it's heap. Example: Everyone was laughing at little old Toyota 20 years ago. Now they're set to overtake GM as the leader. I learned by reading a recent article on the head NA Toyota guy Jim Press that Toyota execs earn less than half of that of comparible giant automakers, yet their quality continues to be at the top of the heap. Add to that Hyundai approaching Toyota-like quality and long term reliability, there's a problem with the way GM and Ford's top-management is conducting business. Were talking about the same companies that started it all, what with GM over 100 years ago and Ford with one of the top 20 inventions of all time, the good ole' Model T.And you're right. It is globalization. I spend time out of the country often, and it seems like we American's are getting the short end of the stick. Look how GM has took every ounce of characterization from Saab(save for the floor-mounted ignition and ""night panel""). Even the Sweedes are  horrified that they're beloved quirky machine rides on a Chevy Malibu platform. They gave these people a freaggin Trailblazer as a ""performance"" SUV for crying out loud. I do give GM credit for resucitating life back into America's luxury car, Cadillac. But even here they short-balled. The Escalade and SRX are going to sell, no matter what. The CTS/STS are great 3/5Series alternatives. The XLR has made a great place in the steel roof HELM market. BUT.. The beautiful and magnificent Six-Teen among other concepts of a few years back are the way to go. They need to invent a true S/7/A8/LS/XJ/Quattroporte-fighter. The DTS, while nice, ain't gonna cut it. Back to globalization. Am I the only one that find it quite strange that Ford won't import it's great Euro Focus into the U.S.? We have the great Mazda 3, but Ford needs to stay competive along with Jetta, Civic, even the upcoming Dodge Caliber(which will be sold in over 100 markets) to keep some sort validity in the small car market. In conclusion, my final thought is this: GM and Ford both need a smash hit like the LX-platformed DCX 300,Charger,Magnum and upcoming Challenger(can't wait). We Americans will continue to buy non-American brands until we get the quality,reliability,perfection,precision,dedication,consistancy,devotion,and loyalty that our hard earned money deserves.

"                I posted this on the 2007 Lexus lsforum, but I am certain that it has relevancy here as well, so here it is:barrys &#150; Your concern about the suggestion that Lexus should actually RAISE its prices is reasonable and logical, IMO.  I agree with you and DrFill that the Lexus price structure does not need encouragement to rise too quickly, for its own sake, but I do believe that the more extreme opinions expressed here will not influence Lexus's strategic marketing.  Remember, Toyota/Lexus is among the best in the world at this.  Many of the Lexus fans on this forum have a major affection for the automaker, which is clear from some of the posts.  This is quite natural for there to be more extreme views like this.  The views expressed by many of the German car fans are just as powerful, and those views sometimes in a similar fashion are supportive of the price and/or value of the German cars.  Let me clarify that I believe that the high-end German car prices are often too lofty and have posted this opinion in the past.  I have also posted that the Lexus price strategy of keeping the prices lower than the competition has been essential to their success, and is, in fact, an integral part of their marketing formula.   I have tremendous respect for companies with brilliant strategies, and I include Toyota/Lexus (Wal-Mart is another) among my most respected.  They are not perfect, of course.  And my respect for them should not be construed as an endorsement or to infer that I am biased in favor of their products . . . just a respect for their marketing brilliance. The price advantage is essential to perceived value.  Consider DrFill's opinion that the S450 cannot compare to the LS460.  Well . . . buyers and critics alike WILL make the comparisons, and as they do so, many of them will draw the conclusion that DrFill draws, partly due to the price difference as it relates to how much car the buyer perceives to obtain for the $$$.  Lexus will continue to stand out as a good value, because it has an historic reputation and foundation based upon reliable value, with good momentum in its wake, and it will be deliberately priced to further the cause.  However, there are other factors that affect the sale of an automobile, and many people will choose other marques instead of the Lexus, of course.  There are no actual ""right or wrong"" choices when purchasing an automobile . . . only a spectrum of preferences, criteria, and/or ""need-fulfillment"" . . . which  buyers will perceive as ""right"" for themselves and/or others.Will Lexus boost prices?  Beyond factors such as monetary exchange rates and/or political global trade pressures, there have been views expressed that they will and that they should deliberately do so . . . and those suggestions of deliberate price increases and a shrinking price gap/advantage have raised your concern.  However, aside from minor fluctuations and tweaking, I think it is clearly more likely that Lexus will stay on their successful path and maintain the integration of perceived price advantage as a key factor in their brilliant and successful marketing strategy.  In essence, it is a key component to what defines Lexus, and Toyota/Lexus is not about to tamper with its core perceptual definition.TagMan            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                i purchased Japanese vehicles when i was younger.  as my income grew along with my interest in automobiles i switched over to German automobiles....and i have never in anyway  regretted that.  if the LexusLS is the most attractive and versatile luxury automobile that the Japanese can offer.... I'm just not interested.  i truly believe if you are an automobile enthusiasts the German brands have so much more to offer than anything currently coming out of Japan.    ? everyone thinks than I'm dumping on Lexus. i cross shopped Lexus every time i shop for a new car.  they manufacture a good vehicle.  but when you compare them to the German competition they are still more than a step behind.  and guys i know they do well in the automotive surveys...and that's great but if you think there is such a dramatic difference between Lexus quality and German quality you are hanging your hats on such a small difference that in the end to me it is a non issue.  ? you know what guys...i also drive an 04 GMC Denali and an 04 GMC crew cab.  both of which have been trouble free.  go figure....American scrap iron!!! and I've had many GM truck products so the reliability and satisfaction i am having with these 2 particular vehicles is not out of the ordinary.  like i said all cars are built well.  if you as purchasers need that little bit of an edge while you purchase a car that's great for you.  keep in mind you are excluding many more exciting vehicles that...by most peoples measure are more attractively designed.    ? as for MB worrying about Lexus I'm sure they do.  i would think they worry about Audi and Cadillac also.  don't forget though...the SClass is still the worlds luxury king and i really don't see that changing anytime soon.  ?as for being number 1...in the US?  everybody keeps pointing to this as if this is the definative measure by which an automobile manufacturer is to be judged.  Lexus is non existant in Europe.  the overall sales figures for the A8, Sclass, and 7 destroy any sales numbers from Lexus.  is it completely insignificant...no not at all.  Lexus is to be congratulated but in a proper context.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I read that BMW is working on a turbo 8 cyl. that might be for the next 7Series.  Does anyone think that they will also offer all wheel drive?  It would seem to make sense since they now have X drive versions for each of their series: 3, 5, suv of course and now will offer the coupe in X drive.  If they don't offer it in the 7, I think it's a big mistake especially if they want to combat the newSClass.  By the way, I think that Lexus misses the boat on this as well with the LexusLS.  Why not offer all wheel drive on the new LS?            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I read your comment as present tense and LS460 based. Thus my answer. Lexus is all of 16 years old so it hasn't been a trendsetter, though the initial LexusLS caused German strategy changes with everything from more powerful engines to quicker model cycles. One could also argue it caused MB to turn more sporty in handling and looks. But to be a trendsetter constantly while you are trying to establish yourself in a market like this would have been suicidal. But life is changing fast now. The lsis now the trendsetter with the 600HL and it has set the bar beyond the SClass. Life changes once you are well established. Lexus' infancy and teenage years are history now.As for this whole argument about helms - I find it rather lame. Lexus reaches over $50K with 4 models - the LexusLS, the LX, the SCand the GX. Under the right scenarios you can add in the RX hybrid too. It reaches over $60K with three of those 4 and over $70K with two of those four if they are fully loaded. With the new lshybrid and the GT it will reach over $100K. I don't see how anyone can argue they are a one car Helm or even begin to argue they don't belong.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hopefully, I will pay enough attention so I won't be actually driving an LexusES by mistake-a sure characteristic of a third plateauer.If  the new lscan core a apple, well, then it's a done deal.I kind of long for those second plateau days.

The other is multi-layer metal with something in between, compared to another piece of regular metal. I knocked at both. The multi-layer metal sounds so quiet. Very impressive.I didn't have much time that day to test drive MB, BMW, etc. Only tested LexusLS, ES330, GS430 and Acura TL. LexusLS is the quietes, and the others are not too far behind.

"                I said: Call me when BMW or MB can simply create an in-dash CD changer that a $15K Kia already does...You responded: idrive equipped BMW5 and BMW7 sales have increased this past year ! Huh ???? i-Drive and in-dash CD changer are related now ? See, the trouble with you and your argument is that they are untenable. Why not just admit your point is pointless...For me, I'll just state the following: that some German cars have reliability issues (MB, VW, especially). BMW is doing well in this area, more than MB at least. MB's biggest problems are electronic failures. The mechanicals (gearing, tranny, etc), body structure, quality of build, NVH, etc are all pretty good. If only they can get the electronics worked out, they'll be fine. VW had a stellar year to date, except in the US market. Audi is doing well, but the A8 still lags its peers in sales here in the US. That grille could do with less ""teeth"", imo. Jag is suffering under the FORD yoke, alas ! Lexus... well they are simply minting money every which way. With the new GS and IS, and soon to come the next LexusLS, they'll gain more market share in the luxury market. So your old-ish BMW and your wife's even more old MB are doing well. Great for you. Some newer models from Bavaria or Stuttgart are not faring that well. And I was just visiting the home of MB just last week... Fabulous place, really. Everyone swears by MB except in Bavaria. With Lexus nipping at the heels of their German rivals, it'll only be good for consumers. I know I'll benefit from an improved lsnext Fall. Trust me, in the HELM market I am not even considering the German's for my money  But when it comes to the small entry-level lux, I can certainly see myself in a 3-er... sans iDrive, sans active steering, but SP-attired, if I can get it at or close to invoice...

"                I know there has been some mention of BMW reliability being good in Consumer Reports. But the latest buying guide I just got doesn't bear that out at all. The best BMW score was the 3Series which was average and a recommended vehicle by CR. The X5 was below average and the 5 and 7Series were much below avearge. The 6 series and X3 were too new and lacked enough data to be scored upon. CR's take of i-drive - irritating and annoying instead of comforting and soothing. That was exactly my opinion of Audi's MMI which is supposed to be a better variation but instead caused you to look more at it than the road. Lexus has slipped a bit as the  RX  (surprise here) and the GX were average, LexusES and GS above average and LexusLS, LX, IS and SCwere all well above average. Everything except LX (probably price as CR recommends the Landcruiser) and GS (ancient) recommended.MB - everything well below average except C-class which was rated as just below average. SLK and SClass did not have sufficient data to be scored. Nothing recommended.Audi - A4 scores average and is recommended. A6 and TT below average and A8 lacks sufficient data.Acura - all above average with MDX & RSX in well above average category. Everything except RL recommended because they haven't tested new RL yet and old one was too dated.Infiniti - FX and G35 recommended and above average. Q45 rated average and M35/45 and GX56 are too new and lack data.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I see a lot more Audi in Conneticut and Wesrchester county. But if you talk to people, many opted for Audi because of the AWD. A4's were very popular in my old West Chestter county office and a few people who worked for me had them. But they were really problematic. A8's are really rare where I am. I've only seen a handful here in all the years I've lived here. I see that manySClass, ls's and 7Series, particularly the first two,  within minutes of getting in my car and driving. While 7's are fairly popular they are far less in number than the lsand S. But the X5, 5's and 3's are enormously popular around here. The ML has seemed to die. It was popular at its onset. TLC's and LX470's are also very popular here.  But everything pales to the RX which you see around every turnThe Audi dealer near me is also Land Rover. I wonder if Audi has a lot of control there. I'll have to drive by and see if they upgraded. About a year ago it was as horrenbdous as ever. Lexus and MB have powerful first class dealerships here as does BMW (though they are a step below). That definitely influences buyers.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I see Jaguar has come up again.  Uuuh..what to do. I think Jaguar's proposed plan (per Automobile Mag) to re-skin the XJ into a CLS/Ripade/Quattroporte/Panamera competitor is a smart plan because the S/7/A8/LS market moves too fast for Jaguar to keep up, especially the technology now being pushed by those cars.  Jaguar is about style, elegance and pace, 2 of those it had over those cars in spades during their boxy days, but now even that is gone when I look at certain models from Audi and Mercedes.  Jaguar's problems could be fixed with a little (ok well a lot of $$$) more investment from Ford IMO.  A small/mid-size RWD platform (that is easily reconfigurable) or ""architecture"" as they're calling it now should be developed for the next X-Type, S-Type, and that F-Type roadster concept presented a few years ago.  Give them all a stunning look, near BMW-level dynamics with a better ride and an exclusive price (while not pricing them out of their segments) and they'll be hits like Jaguar has never seen.  The X-Type failed for two reasons: it was at heart a FWD Ford with a Ford engine, and it looked like a caricature of the real XJ.  People expect the one theme fits all from the Audi/BMW/Mercedes triplets, but not from Jaguar. Luxury cars aren't supposed to appear ""jacked-up"" by physically sitting up higher off the groud at the rear like a hot-rod which is a problem the X-Type suffered from. Jaguar can place a phone call and get their hands on the new I6 from Volvo, tweak it for a good deal more hp and re-engineer it to fit in a rwd layout and poof(!) they'd have something unique over everyone else (except BMW) in their next X/S-Type cars, a good ole I6.  This would do wonders for their image and legitimacy in the luxury car market.Jaguar is not a lost cause, but it will take some vision and major investment (risk taking) to save them on the part of Ford.  Time is running out Mr Ford!  In a way I think Jaguar has been cheated because Ford has pretty much done right (in $$$ too) by Aston-Martin, Land Rover and Volvo.  Volvo which was always profitable, but allowed to remain very independent when it came the product.  There are no obvious Ford products running around as Volvos, though Ford has used everything it can for their cars from Volvo! So far it has been a one-way type deal like that of MB and Chrysler where the European brands aren't hurt. I mean who else besides BMW develops a brand new I6 nowadays?  That is called ""letting Volvo be Volvo"", but this only happened because Volvo has always been profitable according to the industry folks.  If someone could convince Ford that Jaguar is capable of this with one more sizeable investment I think Jaguar could join Volvo in adding to PAG's bottom line.  I mean really if Land Rover (so bad-off at one time not even the business savy BMW could do anything with it) and Aston-Martin (has never made a profit according to some!) can break even (both supposed to have done last year I think) then surely Jaguar can do better and actually make some money. Yeah I know, Ford doesn't have the money right now. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I subscribe to Automotive News and after reading your post I looked at this weeks Auto News issue on the Web. Here are some public links and info extracted from my subscription issue that were provided. The public links from AutoWeek (the Automotive News sister publication) have almost the exact language as the commensurate article in Automotive News. 1. Here is some of the key information from the 2007 Lexus article you mention - ""How high is high enough? How big is too big?"" ""Those are the questions facing Lexus Division, which won the best-selling luxury brand title for the fourth straight year in 2003."" ""But Denny Clements, Lexus general manager, says the brand has fallen into a predictable rhythm - and he wants to change that."" ""We launch a car, then have a minor change after three years, and then a redesign two years after that,"" Clements said during an interview at the Detroit auto show."" ""Meanwhile, the Europeans have new product news and variations coming every year, and they're always on magazine covers. Lexus needs to be like that. Lexus needs to have something always going on. It needs to have that buzz."" ""Clements said Lexus and parent Toyota Motor Corp. have set this stir-things-up agenda for the next few years: - A new distinct design specific to Lexus, to be seen first in the 2005 GS 430 and evolving from there. (Note: the article says a MY05 GS not MY06 which makes more sense like merc1 said a few days ago.)- A redesign of each car line by spring 2007. - All-wheel drive availability with the redesigns. - The addition of a flagship above the LexusLS. - The creation of a factory performance division, akin to Mercedes-Benz's AMG."" ""After spending the last several years bulking up in SUVs, Lexus is returning to its core strength: luxury cars. The next-generation GS 430 and GS 300 sport sedans, which will arrive in early 2005, will be followed by the replacements for the IS 300, ES330 and LexusLS, all arriving by spring 2007."" Very interesting, IMO.2.

ON the Cadillac SUV engine initial statement from the article it goes on the say - ""The move is in keeping with General Motors' plans to create a series of exclusive high-performance cars and SUVs for Cadillac called the V Series. The first of those models, the CTS-V sports sedan, is in showrooms. The CTS-V is powered by a V-8 derived from the engine used in the Chevrolet Corvette."" ""You will find Cadillacs running around with higher-output V-8s, running around with V-10s (and) V-12s,"" Stephens says, ""and you will find even one variant with even more cylinders.""

"  the S320 made up to 40 percent of SClass sales during 1992-1998, In other words, S320 and S280 combined made up for the overwhelming majority of SClass sold worldwide during that time period.  The RL sold during that period had much better power to weight ratio than either model.  The RL owners indeed got their SClass wannabe for half the price! Furthermore the S320 was but one SClass model you still had the option of getting a S420,  SClass or SClass during the W1240SClass' production run. With Acura you had no choice. That is a great MB marketting line.  How many SClass vehicles was the S320 owner buying any way?  Once the S320 was brought home and sitting in the garage, what other engine option did he have?  I suppose every aspiring [non-permissible content removed] should be an A-class or C-class because with MB, you have the option of buying an SClass or even Maybach!  What a joke. Do you realize that it is about darn time? The car has been the same for 9 model years! Talk about not being competitive. Thank you for agreeing with me.  The RL, while not obsolete when introduced in 1996, is quite obsolete today, just like the 3.2 MB engine, not necessarily obsolete in the mid-90's, but quite obsolete today. You're confused on market segments. The E320 doesn't have a chance at 48K of outselling the ES330/TL nor does it compete with it them 33K. It is beyond ridiculous to even suggest such a thing There are two ways of segmenting market: by size and general vehicle characteristics/utility purpose, and by price alone.  E320 is in the same segment as ES330 and TL in terms of vehicle utility purpose and amenity, namely, mid-size sedan with luxury interior appointment.  The price difference just goes to show how non-competitive MB has become even as it cheapens the interior material. I'll give you the the ML isn't even close to being competitive with the RX, no argument there. The utter failure of the ML class, in the fastest growing market segment of the last half decade, is indicative of how critical MB's market position has become.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I suppose you are right.... 118+ years of market presence is tough to undo. MB is resilient and will survive and prosper. BTW, the market valuation of DCX has fallen 50% since the 1998 merger/purchase of Chrysler. Much of that decline due to the hurt on the brand's image. So yes, the problems have really hurt where it matters most... The new releases and updates to styling are in the right direction (mostly), but perception takes awhile to correct, and MB needs to spend lots and lots of money, and years of marked improvements to turn these perception around for the better. OTOH, Lexus continues to just roll on and its brand recognition will only increase at the expense of MB, especially. If the news of the LS600H coming out is anything to go by, MB has its work cut out for the next 5 years to slow the Lexus onslaught. It may not be pretty....            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I need a lil' bit of both.  I am a true driver and if I were able to spend a good $70k+ I know I would be ordering a 7Series.  Price wise I have found both the SClass and LexusLS in that price range, my main reason for looking at them.  I do need more space and luxury than an IS can offer.  I have considered a loaded LexusES but I wonder would a loaded new LexusES really be better than a loaded used LexusLS...or at that aSClass.  Ultimately, the one car I would blow $70k+ on with out a second thought would be a BMW 7.  But for my current price range I havent been able to find a 2002-present 7 for less than $45k.

"                I surely will report back on the Quattroporte. Did you recently see/drive a Maybach or something?   Yes it's still an awesome car in my book, my only real problem is the styling.   I hope the next generation Maybach has a better look outside and a interior not in the same pattern/style as Mercedes'. I read your post on the lsboard, and yes you're right the HPX doesn't look anything like the FX.  I'm not sure what I said back then based on pictures, but after actually seeing it I agree that it doesn't look like the Infiniti FX.  I think some may have got it twisted by thinking just because the HPX was rumored to be launched because of the FX, they convinced themselves that it also looked like it??Naturally I totally disagree with the notion of a SClass being a ""total ripoff"" because it looks like the other SClass models.  TheSClass's power and command of the road is unmatched by anything from Japan.  Only Audi's a8 6.0 W12 looks any different from the basic A8, nobody else does different body work for their V12s or top line cars either.  M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I really dont see Acura doing much damage to Lexus. The two brands are just too differently focused. Lexus' strength, at least right now, comes from LexusES, RX, and LexusLS. Acura cant do a car like the LexusES. The MDX cant sell for $43K+ so they will not be able to offer the level of refinement and materials quality that RX has. Acura has no lsfighter whatsoever. Infiniti also wont do any real damage because Infiniti and Lexus are pretty much polar opposites. The cars that Infiniti has tried to position against Lexus, I and Q, have both been huge flops. You'll notice that the I did not get a redesign with its Maxima cousin. I think it will not get one. Same goes for Q. As OAC said, I think they are content to let Lexus gun for M-B, and generally avoid them. Theres fresh meat on BMW and Audi, and thats where Acura and Infiniti can get stronger. As for the Germans themselves, they are at an interesting cross roads at the moment. They want to preserve their luxury prestige here, but at the same time, they want to offer increasingly lower and lower priced models. Europeans might not even blink at the idea of a C230 taxi cab, but I think that would definitely give American C-class owners some pause. Because they have no ""regular"" Toyota or Honda or Nissan type badge, they must offer the C230 coupe, Audi A3, and upcoming 1Series with the same badge as their $100K machines. I'm not sure in this market that is a good idea. The global auto market at this point is probably the most brutal it has been in history. If you take away your own badge prestige by offering $20K cars with the blue and white prop, 4 rings, or 3-pointed star, how do you continue to justify your asking prices as the Japanese (and Koreans) get stronger and stronger?

                I test drove it and did indeed find the ride far too bumpy for me. The old A8 was a lot smoother but it was noticably rougher than cars like the S and lsto begin with. But I didn't find the new car to be slow at all. So I don't get that one.            ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
                I test drove one today as I'm off this week. Ride is too harsh for such a luxury car and it is not all that quiet. The review in the magazine was right on the money. For Audi's sake I hope it's a first generation production problem. Interior is well designed and luxurious but overall I found the car disappointing because of the ride quality. Car handles very well but it is hardly a sports car. Yet the thumps over uneven road surfaces are more like a sports car. This car will not be a big hit with US luxury car buyers. It may sell 400-500 a month for the first few months than it'll drop back to its normal 200 a month level.The Range Rover (drove it at the same place) is fabulous and is right there with the LX470. Flip a coin as to which is better. I'd actually lean a bit to the RR in luxury and to the LX in ride quality. But the RR rides great and the LX is also quite luxurious. Can't go wrong with either one.Why would you be surprised I recommended an SClass. I almost took one myself. It's a great car - but I don't have great confidence in its reliability vs. Lexus. The Lexus lsbeats it in the things that matter most to me - but not by much. I have no doubt an  SClass will be more reliable than an A8.            ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I test drove the RL last Saturday and if it is not a high-end luxury sedan then it certainly demands consideration.First, the price. At $50K MRSP it is knocking on the door of high priced luxury cars, (ie. LexusLS, E500, Q45).Second, interior look and feel. The driver and passenger seats, fit like a Hong Kong tailored suit. The leather is soft and supple, and the dash is well laid out. Everything is in the right place just like when my grandmother would set the table for a big dinner.Third, the handling is superb. On twisty roads the SH-AWD suspension system surpasses the hype. Go ahead push it around a sharp corner (even with your eyes closed) and the car remains composed. Ah....this is heaven. One down side though, the engine feels a little underpowered. But for the driving demographics for this car it has more power than most can handle. Reported 0-60 times is 6.5 seconds, but it felt more like 8 seconds.Outside impressions, very Accord derivative and overall length is three inches shorter than the 04 RL. But inside, the space and comfort has a big car feel, certainly not as tight as the XJ or A6.Value for the money? You decide. But at $50K I think it is overpriced, then again the car is in such great demand that many will pay that price without blinking an eye.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I think comparing the BMW 7 to the LexusLS isn't really appropriate. Both cars are aimed at different parts of the luxury market. The LexusLS is aimed at Mercedes space. If there is a battle coming for the 7's space it will come out of Infiniti with the new Q which on paper looks like a remarkable car. I can't understand Audi's marketing of the A8. How can you make real money when you sell 2,000 cars in a market like the U.S. Either go after the market full fledge or get out. They seem to be half baked.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I think if you look at the lsand compare it to the 140 Chassis you will notice especially in the rear quarter from the side a very noticeable similarity. Look at the rear window frame and c pillar, rear fender..... The last 140 I delivered to a customer was about 120 miles away. I drove his LexusLS back as a trade. The lswas all over the road at 80 mph. compared to the 140. The change to the 220 at launch in 99 gave me a lighter impression. The sport suspension feature helped but you will not get the same feel with a rack and pinion as opposed to a re circulating ball.Don't get me wrong, I love your car. I just feel as we attempt to get more competitive with the sportier brands we are falling short of the MB ""feel"". The 140 required bigger rail cars to ship. It was just that large.

"                I respect your post, altho I do have a couple niggles with it. One, you say that Audi/BMW are late to the 8-speed slushbox party. Sorry, but everyone is late to that party as it doesn't exist until Lexus brings out the 8-Speed gearbox topping MB's wonderful 7-G only to be topped by Audi's 9-IHJ 9-speed gearbox, DSG, and CVT's in the next-gen A4's and A8's. (All this from a non-HELM?? That's mighty impressive, no matter how long the doc worked today :P )Secondly, you say that the RX and LexusES blew away the comptition . Then why is the RX's sales in the tank, despite the RX400h? Along with the Highlanders(and hybrids) that are dinosaurs on Toyota's lots. The competition has gotten smart......Lastly, I do appreciate the legendary build of the LC/LX. It had up until very recently unmatched quality and the trade off in ride/handling is very well despite the off-road suspension. And it continues with Lexus' tradition of hushed transport. BUT, it is old. Way older than normal update intervals usually are. BUT, both here and in Japan and especially the Middle East, it is still widely lovable. I'm still fond of it. But for $60+k, similar money will get you in newer and more technology-laden models, particularly the Escalade, and for a pinch more, the Range Rover HSE. But neither has demonstrated Toyota's uncanny reliablility(especially the Rover) like the LX.I do appreciate Lexus as a company once again. In this short 15-16 years, the company has transgressed into a force to be reckoned with. But it has had it's share of flaws nonetheless, particularly from '98-'05, where the product, while competitive, didn't quite have the bite like the early-mid '90's cars did.BTW: I didn't know if you knew or not, the Audi allroad was a certified sport ute, according to the EPA. I know, I know, it's still a A6 Avant at the end of the day. Trust me, the Q7 put's some SUV's to shame, which is a true SUV. And to be a true 3Series fighter, and here we go, back to perception, the IS will need a manual to fully compete with it. I know it will blow dust 0-60 over most it's competition, but the manual will complete the package. This is something I've heard Lexus will address for '07. Hopefully awaiting...

"I sure hope GS and IS sales numbers will become a significant contributor to Lexus sales overall. Even at half the volume of LexusES or RX (each close to 100k vehicles, give or take 20k), that will be like another 100k vehicles per year. 300k vehicles a year would be enough to overtake BMW global sales with sales in the US alone! Unfortunately, the GS production line is not much greater than current lsvolume (about 20-30k a year), and IS is only set around 50k units per year. The 1gen IS300 was never targetted to overtake 3Series in sales volume; the production line was only 20k units per year, 1/3 of 3Series sales volume in the US alone. IS300 sold every car there was in the first couple years without heavy discounting. In fact, you could not get close to invoice like normal discounting until the 3-4th year. The car never had $10k+ discounts even to the end like MB is doing on many of its modelsAs to the argument that lssells more due to lower pricing, well, lump-sum $50-70k is actually much more expensive than $450/mo in cash-flow equivalence analysis, assuming disinterested bank rates and normal depreciation. It actualy would not surprise me if MB decide to bring the S350 over in the next generation; if it can make money at $450/mo with it, there will be buyer/leasers. 265hp is plenty enough for a car like that, for chauffer purpose and short business runs in town. The question is whether it can actually make money at that price point.GS V8 to V6 sales volume ratio is about 1:3, about the same as 3Series to 325i ratio, much higher than the 1:10 ~ 1:20 ratio that AMG cars account for among MB's.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think Lexus will to a degree match prices or at least be in the same ball park with the 7Series and A8 this time around, but not theSClass, at least not with the LS460. To push LS460 prices any higher would only make some traditional Lexus buyers who like that price difference between it and a Mercedes question the value part of the Lexus equation. Lexus doesn't want to risk that. Why should they? The traditional Lexicans are right here Steve. To price a Lexus lsthe same as or too close to the Mercedes SClass could produce a ""may as well get the Benz"" reaction from people who are open minded about shopping both brands or those who aren't lead back to Lexus based solely on reliability. Being a value relative to Mercedes (not necessarily BMW and certainly not Audi) is one of the core Lexus beliefs, it was one of the main reasons ""Lexus"" was established. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think merc1 suggested that one of the GS's problems is that it is being marketed, to some extent, as 'sporty', and that this might have been a mistake on Lexus' part. I see his point. Even the original, in 1992, was marketed as a 'sport sedan'...even though I believe it was slower, 0-60, than the lsof the time. I think I remember a marketing tagline that went ""something wicked this way comes"" (or was that in 1998?) The E other hand I perceive as being marketed more as a mainstream luxury car, with the AMG variant taking on the sporting role.Anyway I agree with you that the new GS offers some hope, especially once it goes hybrid. Styling wise, however, I still...based on pictures only...don't see it as especially pretty.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think that you would be surprised how many lsbuyers would go with the SClass if the lswas not available. This is especially the case with the SClass. In my case, I would seriously consider the new SClass if the LS600hL was not around the corner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ES300 is at such an extreme low of the luxury segment and the RX represents such a large portion of Lexus' sales that I can't totally relate to toyotas high-line brand as a top tier luxury make. they're a tweener,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I test drove an ES350 the other day, and all I can say is the car is a much-improved driver and has better fit-n-finish and gadgets than the one it replaces. It doesn't have the bones of the IS/GS, but it is more entertaining to drive than the previous unit.But there is one thing that surely stood out to me about the car. This particular model carried an MSRP of $48k(almost completely loaded), way out of the norm for an ES(previously anyway). So this brings me to my point. With all of this talk about the lspricing, with the fully loaded LexusES commanding 50 thou, the lsmay be priced in the A8/7/XJ neighborhood after all. And this time, it may not take an Ultra to do so. What do you fellas think?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think the current '04 LexusLS looks good too. And so did the 2nd generation, especially the 98-2000 LexusLS. I just wish that it was more distinctive, that it had it's own style completely through. The current LexusLS is pretty nice, but the rear(C-pillar and rearward) looks a little like the old SClass Benz.My accountant was over last week and he just got a new 2004 LexusLS to replace a 00 LexusLS that was totalled. Looks nice up close. The new frontend is a big improvement over the 01-03 front end. The rearend looks a bit better and the wheels are a gigantic improvement over the 01-03 flat dish wheels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think the lsis too good of a car to be supported by such a weak argument that is based on sales volumes, especially when a comparable MB S costs far more. Lower priced luxury cars like the lsdo sell at greater volume than higher priced cars like the MB S . And lower priced luxury cars will sell at greater volume primarily due to price and not due to superiority. You do know that dont you?So my question to you again is what makes the lssuperior to the MB S?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think the only one who really cares about this whole knock-off thing is you. It never even enterred my mind as a buyer of the car in 1995, 1998, 2001 or 2004. I doubt most buyers even think about it. The Lexus brand has fully established itself as the #1 lux plate in the most important market in the world. It will move on to the world markets now and if you think it won't quickly penetrate Europe in the next 5 years you're kidding yourself. The new styles, performance arm and probably both hybrid and diesel engines are all about world expansion. They will establish factories in Europe because that is what it takes to sell there and it fits their currency strategy perfectly. Did you see their profit report yesterday. More than $10bln in earnings - far more than any auto maker and not all that much different than Microsoft or GE. Plus those profits were achieved with a 1.5bln currency adjustment working agaist them at the operating profit level. That clout allows them to do anything they want and they hardly care that a handful of enthuisiast are bothered by a copying issue that extends to only one car. The next lswill end the knockoff argument anyway and the tuning arm will kill the passion nonsense. As I said you're about to run out of road on the things that bother you about Lexus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think when you view individual car stories or even individual car write-ups within a comparative test they provide plenty of data and much of it is good. It is the subjective opinions that they make that are so objectionable. Some of them are so bad that they make those opinions overwrite the actual test results and its clear to me that they preselected the winner before they even tested the cars. My other problem is that they only view the car from an enthusiast point of view (and they also tend to test cars against each other that have different biases thereby making it a worthless test in some cases) and don't weight enough into the whole ownership experience. This is where reliability - which they dismiss so easily - is critical.Conumers reports - the value is in the data they collect and then how they report on it regarding reliability, body integrity, electrical systems etc. They do not view the car through an enthusiast eyes at all (though they have moved a bit in that direction) and are probably the opposite of the auto mags by viewing it (particularly in the past) almost entirely through an ownership experience with the weight being on both past and predicted car reliability based on their ownership survey (which is very large). However they have started to point out fun to drive factors and have rated the old 5Series extremely high and point out BMW handling as superior to most. They've also constantly pointed out that the A8 has an inferior ride to the SClass and LexusLS and state that the latter two are among the finest cars in the world. Their only issues with the SClass are its poor reliability and high price. Otherwise they score that car sky high. I think they know what they are doing (note they were the first, or one of the first, to point out the big drop in MB reliability) but its not the place to go to get an enthusiast viewpoint of a car. But without question they are way more trusted then any auto magazine by consumers and they are not the least bit concerned about advertising as the former are. They are also quite ready to be bold and can move the whole market - witness Isuzu in the 90's.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think you missunderstood me about the Q45, it's a good car, and I happen to actually like it, especially more than it's cross-town rival. But to say it's %95 of what you'll get with an SClass or 7Series is a little too far fetched. Sales while not a end-all determining factor, they do gauge what people think about the car *to a degree*. My point was that this car if it was so close to being an SClass or 7Series the word would have gotten out now, and it wouldn't be dead in the water in only it's 2nd model year. The Q45 doesn't have the ride/handling mix of those cars. It doesn't ride as smoothly as the S and it can't hope to match the 7Series for sportiness. The Q surely isn't ninety-five percent of the SClass or 7Series either when it comes to features, especially when talking about theSClass. Styling is a personal thing, and to most the Q missed the boat. Nissan/Infiniti also tried to market the car as a sport sedan, of which it isn't, that helped kill it in the marketplace. They also bragged about it's hp and the car when initially tested wasn't no where near as fast as it should have been considering it had a 30-40hp advantage on the class, again at that time. The M45 surely didn't help matters either. The Q just came out for the 02 model year, so thats why its not getting any refresh for 04, plus the car has been a sales dud, so it's hard for Nissan to justify the money for something like that. Bottom line the Q45 is a good car, but when it comes to S, A8 and 7Series territory being a ""good"" car doesn't cut it. It's about %70 percent of those cars, no where being %95. It's really a good car in search of proper marketing and some fine-tunning if they truly intend to position it as aSClass, 7Series or A8 alternative. jagboyxtype, Exclusiviity is a often-used excuse when a car doesn't sell well. If you were to say the Jag is exclusive I'd agree, they didn't go for volume in the first place, never really have with the XJ. Thats not Infiniti's case. So the SClass is a cookie-cutter design because its used a taxicab in it's home country? You said that just to take a shot right old friend? M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think you missunderstood what I meant. What I'm saying is that sales of the RS6 aren't as important, hence the small numbers make good sense....it's the sales of the regular A6 models that are helped by having a car like the RS6 on board. Yes Audi has issues at the dealership level, but it's not as widespread as some would like you to believe. Your point about what Audi needs is almost correct....actually they need both...cars like the RS6, S8 etc and a good dealer body to compete with Mercedes-Benz, Lexus, BMW etc. The ""profits"" on the A6 range have probably been made already hence the very late arrivial of a car like the RS6. Profits are not everything, thats what I like about the European makes, they'll build the fun cars...profits not being the main priority, the cars are. Again, Audi will ""profit"" from those regular A6s that are sold, and at the same time the whold brand is strengthened. M, AMG and S cars are NOT about sales, thats what the regular models are for. These are specialty cars and specialty cars are....well the specialty of most European carmakers. Rare cars like the CL55, SL55, M5, Z8 and the like build the image of the brand which in turns opens the wallets. People who buy SClass with the AMG Sport package get a car that looks very similar to a S55, that has it's appeal. Trust me Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi don't build anything they can't make money on. Especially Mercedes-Benz. I just don't think a person that likes a car like the LexusLS will ever see the point of a RS6, M5, E55 etc....again nothing wrong with a Lexus, but the excitement is sorely missing. ljflx,Your numbers about AMG's production and employees *sounds* about right, from what I last read on AMG myself. However AMG may have just as well been in-house all along, the two guys that started AMG are former MB engineers. Complete MB ownership of AMG isn't complete until 2007. Mercedes is now working with Brabus (in secret). If you think AMG's cars are over the top check out some of Brabus' work. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I too hated the looks at first, but someone on my street has one, and seeing it everyday has changed my view of it. Sure, it's noSClass, 7Series (have you seen the spy pics of the newest one, my god is that a beautiful car), or the king, Jaguar XJ, but I like it better than the lsand the Audi A8. Now, when you factor is price, amenities and driving dynamics, it is right up there with the 7 and S. I think it is a fantastic addition to this market~ A.R.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I too think there will be a S450, just not right now. I really don't think adding a 335hp S450 will actually help sales in the short term. The S450 is going to have to get more competitive under the hood or come in under or at best at the same price as the a8 and 750Li, it can't cost 77K like the old SClass for it to be competitive with those cars now and Mercedes really can't sell a V8 SClass for much less I don't think. Long before the W221 was ever shown the rumor mill always forecasted a direct-injection V8 for the S but then it changed to those engines weren't ready at the time of launch. I just think that MB has had to rethink the S450 because of cars like the LS460 and 750Li. If they bring in a S450 at even 75K it just won't do much again, IMO. My theory is that the new V8s will get direct injection for 2008 or 2009 and then we'll get a S450 with around 365hp and the SClass will be taken over 400hp. Mercedes it appears has opted not to put the new V8s in the ML or R-Classes either for MY2007 so something is up there, I think. Either that or they're waiting to see where the LS460 lands in price and go from there. That could be what they're waiting to see also. You are right about some not caring for the amount of hp or the 0-60 times, but I think now the ante has been upped and these cars are more competitive now than ever before. I mean the SClass comes withing 7 hp of the 1993 V12 600SEL! I think that right now a 335hp S450 would actually cost MB some sales as crazy as that sounds. A S450 will likely be still priced above the LS460 (maybe about the same as a LS460L would would make it even worse for the S450 hp wise) and that just doesn't add up and some buyers will likely walk away from the ""S-Class"" period without feeling they shouldn't have to pay 86K (to start) for a more ""competitive""SClass. As it stands right now there is no waffling, you either ante up 86-106K or not and be done with it. I think I like it that way until MB can make the S450 more competitive. I bet BMW won't import the 300hp 7Series here for similar reasons. This situation with the S450 is kinda like the W140 S320. Now that car made up 40 percent of SClass sales during some of those years according to an article I read some years ago, but it was dropped when the W220 was introduced. Why they brought over the W220 S320 7 years later for just 1 year is beyond me, but still I think MBUSA just didn't see the point of trying to pedal a car that was so lacking under the hood. If there has to be a cheaper SClass I'd rather it be a 50-state certified S320 Bluetec, now that would be nice. Lastly, how is your SClass???M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think it is pretty clear, others got exactly what I'm saying. I see your point about the RX and LexusES, but they are only 2 models. If you clearly don't see where the pricing structure of MB would inhibit overall sales then forget everything I've said because you'll never get it. You're pointing to 2 Lexus models out of what 7(?) compared to 2 out of 9 for MB, most of which are price higher. You honestly don't see this? Only the ML and C are even competitive with Lexus pricewise. What about the SL, CL, S, G, the AMG models, the CLK Cabrios? They do try to move these too, while costing way more $$$$. The average msrp for a Benz is higher than it is for Lexus. I don't see how it could be any simpler than that. syswei, Styling and sales....read back a few posts, this whole round got kicked off on just that point. Anyway that pales in comparision to you having considered EClass in the past! You did it again, I'm baffled by that. The E and GS in sales.........hmmm. Prestige, styling, depth of models, more recognition in the segment (the E has been the top seller since the mid-90s in the med-luxury market) I'm sure all have something to with the E outselling the GS. But I think the biggest mistake was that Lexus decided to go after BMW's 5Series in the ""sport"" game. I don't see Lexus buyers lining up to buy a sports sedan in the middle segment, or any segment. The GS and IS have proven this year after year. It certainly isn't because they cost too much, the lsoutsells the GS and the LexusES the IS, clearly Lexus buyers prefer luxury over sport even though the lsand LexusES cost more than the GS and IS. The GS400 was only about 7/10ths BMW 540i and nobody shopping for a Lexus seemed to care. The milder GS300 was bought like 3 to 1 over the GS400, and the LexusLS and now LexusLS isn't all that much more money, but is a lot more car than the GS430..so the GS430 and (base) LexusLS models might be to close together. Just some of the reasons I see. I think overall the Lexus image is too stuffy to sell a sports sedan in any great numbers. The Lexus owners on this board have proven not to care one bit about ""sport"" when it comes to their sedans. This theory will be tested with the next IS. They're going all out this time around. No more re-badged Toyotas. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I understand your points, especially about style. Yes, I agree that the MB has had better style. What other qualities has it had that have been superior to the Lexus? Please don't tell me it is faster, more powerful, etc. After a certain point, who cares how fast or how many horses it has? The question I asked is, what has been a better vehicle with all factors combined. I honestly do not see how anyone can argue that it has not been the LexusLS. I also do not care what the Europeans think. They are ""brain-washed"" in my opinion. Yes, yes, some will say that we here in the U.S. are ""brain-washed"" toward the LexusLS. But again, the facts are that the lsis a better car for the reasons I stated on the above post. I am trying to use logic here. What difference does it make that the MB has been around for 100 years. So what? That in itself does not make it a better car. And I couldn't care less about status either. I keep coming back to which is a better car with all the factors combined. The factors that count to me include: reliability, luxury, comfort, technological enhancements, safety, environmental concerns, and style. Of these, the only one that the MB has had over the lshas been style. That will also narrow with the new LexusLS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I was speaking in terms of what Mercedes has in relation to Acura. Did I say Mercedes had active suspension first? No, I didn't. Not to burst your bubble either, but since you want to go into who was ""first"" it wasn't Infiniti. It was a certain French brand, uh Citroen. Years before the Japanese even got a clue. The retracting hardtop was done ""first"" again by Ford in the 1950's, not Mitsu. Secondly both Mitsu and Infiniti's take on both of these technologies failed. The Mitsu top was this much away from being junk as it never worked as advertised. Is that all you have to offer is ""who brought hybrid technology to the market first""? Yeah I'm dying to drive a Prirus or Insight. Is Acura a technoloy leader? No they aren't! ""Mercedes doesn't wipe out anybody"". There sure as hell wipe out Acura, which is a 2nd tier brand at best. You'd have to be on whatever Whitney is on to think Acura as a whole is on the same level with Mercedes. Acura's sheet metal is not the same gauge as Mercedes', who told you that lie? Wake up, anyone that knows Hondas will tell you they use some of the thinnest sheetmetal going today. wishnhigh1, I've never read so much ranting about nothing. When are you going to realize that the Japanese idea of luxury isn't everybody's. You admit that it's not an issue with a Porsche, but yet you can't understand that Mercedes (across the street) from Porsche was also under the same thinking at the time. If you're going to harp about CD players with cars as basically good as BMW, MB and Audi then they're definitely not for you. You and this CD player thing is about the most ridiculous thing you've come up with yet. For your information (stay current) Mercedes, BMW and Audi are all switching to DVD based Nav systems during 2003. ""WHO THE HELL USES THOSE THINGS?""Are you speaking of trunk mounted CD changers? I hope not, because if you are you know not of what you speak. Who uses them? Lexus, Infiniti, Acura, Mercedes, BMW, Jaguar, Audi, Cadillac, and just about every other luxury car going. Lexus, just like Mercedes didn't even offer and in-dash unit on their top lsmodel until recently, they too used CD changers before offering the in-dash unit with the LexusLS, ditto for the ES300. In-dash CD players/changers were not popular or offered up until the last few years, on any Japanese or European luxury car. So now what? ""And I am not saying they didn&#146;t have the technology, of course they did. BUT THEY DONT IMPLEMENT IT!!!!!!""Really? Mercedes didn't implement electro-hydraulic brakes or active rollover protection either huh? Mercedes crumple zone technology is blueprint that every single car on the road today uses, and they (Mercedes-Benz) did it first! Do you really think Acura compares to a Benz in safety engineering? Please. ""f this is purely out of debate about technology, then you are right, Mercedes is better off(except on electronics). But from what I was reading in this topic, it was about whether Acura can compete with Mercedes.""Oh so you ranted only to agree in the end. Can Acura ""compete"" with Mercedes, sure they can at the TL/C-Class level, but beyond that they have nothing even worth mentioning. Period. Now tell me how much of a better car the RL is compared to EClass . Acura is still sitting on the porch watching the bigdoggs play. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I was talking wiht a friend of mine about this line up of autos. We came to the conclusion that the figures just dont add up. It is not completely fair to put these cars up in head to head competition. The Mercedes and BMW both have sitcker prices arround 95+. The Jaguar and Audi ring up at arround 70K, and Lexus starts arround 55K. All five are great cars but i personaly believe some are just better than others, not because one is a lesser car, but it is just not in its own league. After doing some research The Lexus is more comperable to a 5Series BMW or aEClass Mercedes. When you look at the competition that way, its pretty clear who is on top. The LexusLS offers more toys than either of the 2 Germans and puts it in a totaly different class.Each of these cars has a totaly different personality. Audis are still a sleeper, the A8 is understated, no one realises it is what it is. Bimmers are known for a sporty reputation. Jaguars are the stuffy british kick, great style and pleanty of problems. Lexus seems to be a total isolation vehicle, a place to get away from any and all noise. Mercedes has always been the ultimate in status, not that is is the best thing out there but its all status.To say any of these cars is better than another is impossible, they all have some quirk that gives them an edge, i would kill to get into a design center and make my ideal car with all the best things from all the above makers. That would be my super car!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I went to the ""Taste of Lexus"" earlier today, as always with these types of events it&#146;s a real up close look at the cars without the sales folks. They had every Lexus model there for people to drive. I drove the LexusLS, IS350 and GS430. Surprisingly (or not surprisingly in the day of $3 gasoline) no one drove the LX470 for a while during the 3 1/2 hours I spent there. First the not-so-good stuff. Looking around at all of Lexus' there is nothing there with any sizzle to it. No rare models, no styling, much less anything exotic looking. There is nothing special about the brand, no racing history to read about, no vintage cars, nothing in the way of oooh ahh..type things you get at similar events from Lexus' competitors. Lexus is too synthetic. They didn't even have their usual trophy wall stacked with JDP awards. Uh...hello Lexus this is your claim to fame. As usual they go out of their way to make it nice, meaning a lot of fufu food and other non-automotive things for folks who feel the must be pampered at a ride-n-drive event. Mercedes, BMW and Cadillac are guilty of having all this irrelevant stuff going on also. I would spend that budget on getting more competitor cars there and longer Now......about the IS350. Holy (expletive) this car is fast. I was lucky enough to be there when they had some professional drivers (they should have asked me!) race the IS350 and the 3Series . People boo'd because the IS350 got a head start on the 3Series , but after driving the IS350 myself there is no contest in the way of straight-line speed. The IS350 is a rocket. I was shocked in seeing the IS350 and 3Series side by side. In pictures I was almost convinced that Lexus had a winner on their hands in the styling department, but in real life a 3Series with the sport package (18 inch wheels) looks better than the IS350 to my eye. The IS350 looks like something Scion would come up with imo. It almost looks like a 4-door Scion TC Coupe. Mind you it isn't ugly by any means, but the BMW looks better imo. There is no imagination to the IS, all flat, broad expanses of unadorned sheet metal with nothing to break up the monotony. The BMW at least in sport guise looks more aggressive and cutting edge. Enough about styling, the driving is where the real fun is. I was told to floor the IS350 so naturally I did. In a few eye blinks its time to get on the brakes...like now! I'm at the end of the straightaway part of the course. The only other 6-cylinder sedan I remember with this much pull was the C32 AMG. Where the IS and 3Series are clear opposites is in their interiors. The IS350 is a mini GS, snug and comfortable and luxurious. The 3Series is actually much roomier, even in the front. The 3Series has a more spartan interior, but the test car did have the wood trim and idrive which helps a lot. A non idrive 3Series is really plain on the inside like BMW of the early 90's. The 3Series shines on the handling course. It has a tighter, more buttoned down feeling to its handling and steering, where the IS350 is lighter and not as precise, but could be deemed as more ""fun"" to some, while the 3Series is more serious. My take is the IS350 will suit Lexus buyers perfectly, those looking for something a little sportier than the normal Lexus, but those used to BMWs will likely stick with BMWs. That firm, almost heavy feel of the BMW just isn't there in the IS350. The IS350 is a worthy competitor, but the look is plain and sterile imo. I do wonder why they didn't make it a tad bigger though, its really a tight fit for some folks. Funny how things change, BMWs used to have that same cockpit feeling that the IS350 now has, a feeling that the 3Series doesn't give off as vividly as it did in the past. The BMW was also quieter. :confuse: Next, up I drove the GS430. They had an E500 there for comparison. The GS430 actually has better steering than the E500, but their handling is about the same. Neither car is a 5Series, which wasn't there for comparison. I would have really liked to have seen a M45 there also, but I think Lexus knows better than to have a 550i and M45 there, especially on such a tight course, the GS430 would be embarrassed quite easily. Naturally they had the softer of the two premier German competitors there, the E500. The E and GS are the same in acceleration too, with the E500 reaching for extra gears when it was time to hit the brakes I would like to have had some extra room to see what these cars would really do. I haven't driven the new GS without a sales person present, nor have I driven the E500 since it got the new 7-speed tranny. Pretty much comes down to style and whatever other personal criteria a person has here as both cars were equally impressive. I didn't drive the SC430 because the line was too long and in 50 degree weather I was not about the stand in line that long to drive a convertible. The SCand IS350 were the most popular vehicles there by far. The LX470 just the opposite. After the IS and SCcame the RX400h, everyone wanted to drive it. I can't stand SUVs so I passed. Finally I drove the LexusLS. Other than the quality and reliability I don't see anything else appealing about this car. The design is aged, upright and just about as non-aesthetically pleasing as possible. There is nothing special here in the way of design over anything at Toyota dealership. Sure everything is of the highest quality and what not, but the look of it, yuck. Why Lexus had a handling course for car like the LexusLS is beyond me. They used to have a bumpy section and an evasive maneuver for you to go through, which would make more sense than a slalom/handling course. The LexusLS keeled over like an old battle ship on the handling course. The steering is completely lifeless and felt like something in an old-school Cadillac. It is church quiet though. I mean nothing. No suspension noise, no nothing, but I did make the tire protest about my driving. They also had the IS250 and GS300 there, both cars in either rwd of awd. They didn't have a 325i to compare with the IS250, but they did have a 530i there for competitive drives against the GS300. I couldn't stand the cold (wind) any longer to drive all of them. Just like I suggested to Mercedes last year around this same time, these events need to be held in the summer or spring for Chicago, Oct. weather is too dicey for outdoor stuff. In summary, I was most impressed by the IS350 and pleasantly surprised by the GS430. Slowly, but surely Lexus is discovering that people might actually want to drive instead of just commute. The IS and GS are more entertaining to drive than any Lexus of the past. The LexusLS was about what I expected, having driven one back in 2002. The IS250 and GS300 will have to wait until another time. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I whole-heartedly agree with your testimony. I had numerous problems with my '98 lsthat I promised myself that I wouldn't ever buy another again, no matter how reliable they were supposed to be. In a short 32,000 miles, the steering rack and both front hubs had to replaced($6k job, albeit all under warranty). Then the cluster failed twice, and then the electrical system went hay-wire. It reminded my of my 1990 Jaguar XJ VDP. Like yourself, I was completely let down on this car compared to my '92, which believe it or not, only had a bad battery and two flat tires in 76,000 miles. I eventually unloaded the lsfor a '01 SClass which was a model of both quality and reliability, despite the reputation. It has to be said that not everyone is on the ""Lexus is for everyone"" band-wagon. May it be style or just utter disgust, it's not for everybody. If Sam had a terrible experience with the cars after spending a huge bundle over time with the company, then I would very upset with them also, which was the case with myself.The Lexus is a time-honored vehicle as it should be in it's own right, but it is ""NOT"" the perfect vehicle most Lexus customers would lead a person to believe. Up until the upcoming LS460, the post '01's looked more like a puffed-n-buffed Buick Park Avenue than luxury distinctive,IMO.I now drive one of the less talked about vehicles on the HELM, the A8. And very happy with my purchase and wouldn't get rid of it for any car that's out now(maybe the upcoming S8). And maybe that's a good thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I would suggest you don't go the route of saying x car is better than y because of sales numbers. If the 3Series is better than the IS300 because of sales, by your own logic, then the LexusLS must be better than the 7Series, and the RX-better than either the X3 or X5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I, for one, did not base my purchase on what magazines said. They ranked the XJ dead last in the ""performance super sedan"" category every time. But based on what I read between the lines, I could sense my personal ranking would be different, simply because I value different stuff higher than the editors did.Every magazine I have seen rates the dynamic behavior of the LexusLS behind Beemer, MB and Audi. Check this very site, or the New York Times Automobile section (which, by the way, I think the most informative, because they simply praise the good aspects of a car, try to come to grips with the design philosophy, and never go for simplistic rankings). Then again, no one buys any of these cars for their lap times around Laguna Seca. But the fact remains that, when it comes to handling prowess, about every editor says the same [quote from New York Times]: "".. I have to acknowledge that after a week in the Lexus on the mountain roads of Santa Barbara County, it was a relief to go back to my own Nissan Maxima, with its tighter, more responsive steering and better road feel. .."" To claim, as if being doen repeatedly here, that the Lexus is ""class best"" in pretty much everything is silly. They'd monopolize the market here.b There is nothing the remotely resembles ""fact"" to buttress such partisan views.""Relevant to its price"" is relative, too. I, for one, am picky about interiors, and must say I prefer the Mercedes' to the Lexus'. It's because of styling. I find the Lexus a bit too Detroit-like, noveau-epoque Lincoln-like. Nice materials, very comfortable, but subjectively somewhat old. I could say ""I would expect more for the price"", but I simply realize others love it, are more than entitled to their view and personal taste, which is just as valid. I do not try to come up with artificial ""bang for buck"" scales that are fake facts, badly disguised personal preferences that state that *I* find I'd prefer different execution. And if I have a choice between a $5,000 Brioni suit, and a $6,500 Byblos suit, I'll simply buy the one I like best. Once I have committed myself to a somewhat irrational pricetag, I better get what I simply like *best* and suits *me* personally. It'd be stupid to think the $5k suit is a ""smarter buy"" if I simply like the other suit more. It's not. It is dumb to compromise once you've gone that far.Sure, car handling is subjective, too. It's great the Lexus dynamic behavior suits you fine, and no one doubts it has a sweet engine, and that its ride is buttery. But you always go the extra step and make those points at the detriment of the other cars' merits. Merits that about every writing so-called expert has already established. And while they might not be as relevant to your choice, it is silly to try to re-define obvious statements.I don't mind you making your point, of course not. I totally believe you are extremely happy with your car. But why do you have to keep on making value statements about the other cars, particularly some that can be proven wrong easily.The interior of the SClass is not cheap. That is a ridiculous statement. Every car in here has one or the other cheap touch - it is a general automotive trend, sadly. About the only thing find somewhat cheap about the SClass is the little plastic drawers under the seats (which you never see), and the cup-holders (according to one owner, and cup-holders in car being a US aberration anyway that are ugly no matter what. Whoever tells me their cupholders are sumptuous will see me laugh at them). All cars cut corners.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'll ask again, why do S and A8 owners like their cars less than lsand 7 owners? Why do they seem to be less ""enthusiastic""? And if they aren't happy with their cars, even apart from the quality issues, what is going to happen to the S's worldwide sales ""dominance""? ?Data from this site: http://www.jdpower.com/cc/auto/jdpa_ratings/FindJdAwards.jsp ??...call up the 2004 A8, 7, S, and LexusLS. You'll find that, even ignoring the quality-related issues and focusing instead on performance, comfort, features, style, and overall appeal, actual owners of A8s and Ss DON'T like their cars all that much, on average, whereas owners of 7s and LSs DO. ?It seems to me that the lsand 7 are ""on a higher level"" than the S and A8.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I think it would be harder to isolate any single factors in the mid-size, lux SUV market b/c there is a much broader range of product within a $10k price range to choose from. I do believe the RX has had a longer run, popularity-wise, as a ""car-like"" SUV given its car platform, which in this market has turned out to be what more people wanted. Plenty of people told me they thought the ML rode rougher than the RX, and it did. And there is no question that the RX, while having a couple of problems, was a Maytag compared to the 1st gen ML, which has certainly turned a lot of people off.(to the ML) Also, in the SUV market, there are more middle income, discount motivated buyers, and if what you say is true, and Lexus carries a 12-15% markup, which I would find easy to believe since it shares platforms with the camry, rav-4, highlander, and LexusES, then they have more room to negotiate. And I can promise you, even if it's not the way you think, lots of people in this tier of the market will buy the choice B car, if they're getting the bigger discount on that car. Just today I lost a deal on an ML500, to a cadillac SLR, which in mine and his opinion is an inferior vehicle which will also depreciate much quicker.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'll shorten this from the News and View version which covers ""everything"". I spent two days total at the show, it's so much more than Chicago's autoshow. Acura has proven to me that they don't hold water to the Euro luxury brands past the TL class. The RL and NSX sat unloved with all the attention at the Acura display going to the TL and TSX. I heard one person say, ""this is their new sports car"", pointing to the NSX. I wanted to say, dude this ""new"" car is 15 years old!!!?BMW has lost me. The 5Series has an interior to match the exterior, a mess. Did anyone check where the door grab handles line up with the dash when the doors are closed? The only BMW I like now is the M3. I could barely do anything until I laid my eyes on the 6-Series. Rarely does a coupe look better than it's convertible counterpart, but this is the case with the 6. The convertible's top up look is truly ugly. The Coupe is no beauty either, but in a darker color it does *somewhat* hide that hideous trunk lid. What the hell is BMW on? Lexus' new GS...ah the subject of much infighting within the Lexus camp. Another not ugly, not much to look at design from Lexus. It has a hint of the new 5 in the front-fender treatment and its grille is pure Camry Solara, but overall it isn't as bad as some have said, including me. If anything it's just too derivative. Ironically autospies is saying the LF-S is the next IS, figures since they said it was the GS before. Does it look better than EClass (the car I see most compared to the GS), heck no it's not even close. Otherwise Lexus' display was just as unimpressive as their lineup of cars. One thing about Lexus that impressed even me, was their JDP awards display. My god they've won every award possible! Infiniti was all the rage except for the M and Q ""45"" models that sat mainly with their doors closed and no lookers. The QX56 has way too much grille, other than that it looks pretty good. Then again, I like the Nissan version also. The G35 Coupe (before I buy one) is missing one thing, a decent interior. So cheap it is. Audi.....always one of my favorites. One of my favorite sedans of all time, the current A6 is finally showing its age. It looks dated next to the A6 and A8, though it took 7 years to get to that point. The price has gone up a lot too, a loaded 2.7t ""S line"" model is 50K!! The new-look grille on the a8 6.0 is gorgeous. It says power, which is what the a8 6.0 has. The LeMans Quattro is another stunner. Not sure how accurate this is, but one of the reps said look for the production version at the 2006 NAIAS. Ferrari and Maserati are 1 for 2. The 612 Scagletti, while not ugly or as questionable as the Enzo was upon first glance, does have some issues. Two things, the long hood and the space over the front wheels, far too much space in the wheel wells. I'll have to wait and see this one in different colors because the side treatment is hidden in dark red paint of the one car they had on display. This is not a good sign, it should be love at first sight with Ferraris. Look for a facelifted 360 Modena at Geneva in March. The Maserati Quattroporte on the other hand looked just like I thought it would. Unique, and different, but a looker. It's interior is even better than the exterior. What a sensuous luxury car compared theSClass, 7Series, LexusLS, and A8. Only the Jaguar XJ approaches this car in that respect. Major crowds at their combined displays, I mean can't even move around or get closer to the display without pushing type of crowd. So stylish the Italians are! Mercedes-Benz. Why wasn't the CLS flown in after the L.A. show was over? The GST should be hit with the crossover crowd.....it looks ok I guess, me no likem SUV/Crossover things much. The SLR was stunning, and smaller than I thought it would be. People stood around in a daze. I still say Mercedes' ""best"" car is the CL coupe, it felt custom made for me. The E55 and SL55 drew a lot of attention too. The SLK is done, little or no interest. Look for a Geneva debut for its replacement. The SClass is in ""classic"" status now, still looking good, but you sense there is something new coming soon, and it is. The CLK, while not as hot as the previous generation (to me, the market says different) had a considerable line waiting to sit in them, especially the Cabrio models. Aston-Martin. Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous. The DB9 Volante had people mesmerized. I heard all kinds of conversation about this car. They could have picked a better color than that powerdery blue for the interior, but still a real looker. Ahh..the Vanquish a pit-bull on wheels. Can't say enough about how good these cars look. Same level of people as Ferrari/Maserati display. Thick. Bentley. The Continental GT is a hit with the press and show goers alike, but it looks like a giant VW or some type of shoe to me. They had one there and it was the ugliest blue you can imagine. One thing about the Conti though is that it makes the Arnage and Arnage RL look like they're from another era, of which they are. Not quite as crowded as the above brands, but still crowded. VW, yes VW they have some ""high-end"" products now. Surprise, surprise, people actually liked the Phaeton a lot, which I just my first TV commercial on, btw. Nobody seemed to be shocked at how much it costs. Did people looking at it know that its a relative of the A8 and is made by basically the same company? Seems they did. The Phaeton is also a comfortable car too, especially in the rear seat. Lots of buttons though. This biggest of VWs might have a chance here judging purely on the crowd reaction to it is any indication.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm 6 ft 3 inches and with seat on the bottom, I can put my doubled up fist on top of my head in the Lexus LexusLS. I think you would find the Lexus ES300/330 a tight fit. As for ice & snow, the LexusLS is a rear wheel drive like the BMWs and MBs. You would need to get the top of the line snow tires. I believe the Lexus has the best reliability record. I would stretch the purchase to a 2001 if possible, NADA Trade in Value at 50,000 miles at 37K and Dealer Retail at 42K. I note the 2000 LexusLS at 60,000 miles is 25K and 29K. Quite a difference but the car is the upgrade year 2001 if I recall correctly. Also take a look at post 6390 & 6391 in the Lexus lsforum (this web site). As for warranty, you can only buy the Lexus Factory Extended Warranty up to 36 months and/or 36K miles, whichever comes first. I'm sure there are some after market policies out there. Good luck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm curious to know what you didn't like about the Audi and what you did like about the 7Series. They also had the uber-VW there too??&#148;I was hoping that Audi would &#147;drastically redesign&#148; the flagship A8L. The front looks essentially the same (has the same general shape; same with the grille), the side looks? well not that exciting. As for the rear, I don&#146;t know what to say. It just doesn&#146;t look the same to me as when the 2000 SClass came out and when the controversial 7Series came out in 2002.Now? as for the 745Li?I just think that overall, it has the best design. Outside- the front truly does look like an eagle, with the &#147;eyebrows&#148; in the headlamps. The wide kidney grille looks majestic. But for me, and most beautiful aspect of the vehicle is the side-profile view. The shape, and lines, and chrome trim (I particularly enjoy viewing the rear doors on the Li model, with that opera window?). Now, I must confess that the rear of the 7 is indeed strange, but sometimes, we have to accept different ideas, whether for the good or the bad.Another part of the car that I love is the interior and performance. The inside looks like the interior of an airplane- the ways things are laid out? the only negative issue I have with the interior design is the position of the iDrive display, as I believe it reduces visibility. Ah yes? iDrive, another issue. I must say that even this system is more complicated than my MBSClass&#146;s COMMAND system. But, as we have already seen, Audi&#146;s MMI technology (incorporated in the new A8L) is basically based on it (I don&#146;t buy it when people deny that). Hey, this isn&#146;t the first time a new idea was widely rejected- I remember clearly when Acura (I believe) introduced the moon-roof, a feature that the Germans didn&#146;t seem to understand nor appreciate. Nowadays, almost every car, from Honda to Maybach, offers or features a moonroof. Now, enough of moonroof.Now I am certainly not saying that MB builds bad cars like theSClass. Of course, you really can&#146;t get any better than a S (not counting Maybach, Rolls Royce, Bently?). A Mercedes will always be a Mercedes, and I really believe that is why Mercedes has such a high repeat-customer rate. Mercedes will always be first, and BMW, Audi, and Lexus will never pass MB.As for the VW Phaeton, it will not be at the motortrend event; only the SClass, 745Li, and A8L.By the way, I went to my local VW dealership to view the new SUV, the Toureg, as well as any info regarding the phaeton. Apparently, he was new and had no idea about the Phaeton (but did know a lot about the Toureg). The Toureg was really beautiful, with striking resemblance to the Porsche Cayenne.In my opinion, I don&#146;t know who on earth would buy a VW at that high of a price. I may as well get a MB, BMW, Lexus, Infiniti, or Audi. The rear looks absolutely hideous in my opinion. I just don&#146;t understand how are they going to sell this product?My best friend just got a 2003 SL55 AMG and a 2003 SClass 4Matic together! He loves them, and is currently at a MB-hosted private Golf-event for patrons who purchase 2-or-more MB&#146;s at one time. He called during the party and said that there was an Iranian doctor who bought 8 MB&#146;s all at once! (gee, even in this economy!)merc1- now I would like to know your opinion on the new Audi a8 (you say very close to theSClass), and why you included the Jag and the Infiniti Q45 (i really don't understand the design team of the XJ, and i figure at the same price, you can get a much better car; ls)P.S.- you guys should check out this article on cnn.com/money about reliability (yes, the Japanese are still the best when it comes to reliability, I guess:http://money.cnn.com/2003/07/08/pf/autos/bc.autos.durability/inde- x.htm?cnn=yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"I'm just a 31-year-old man who loves cars. After reading all these debates on Germans vs Japanese, reliability, and electronic complexity, I feel like these debates will go on until the end of time. Let's just agree that it will never be resolved, and let's talk about what we love about cars.I work long hours everyday (6 days a week most of the time), and all I have to look forward to is time with my wife and our families, watching sports, being with friends, and driving our two cars. I drive a 2003 Audi A6, and my wife drives a 2000 BMW 3-coupe. Yes, we do like our German cars. The Audi is very comfortable, roomy, and pleasing to the eyes (both exterior and interior). The BMW is very fun to drive and looks great. Although we've enjoyed having them, they are not the most reliable cars that we've ever had. The Audi has been in the dealership once for rear window not coming up. The BMW has been in the dealership for several issues (VANOS intake system malfunction, molding came unglued twice, peeling of interior parts, and bad cd player). The Japanese cars that we've owned prior to the Germans never had any issue. This is not saying that Japanese cars will not have any problem and German cars will. It just means that this is what happened during our ownership. I've also owned two BMW's prior to the Audi and had many problems with both of them. Even though I had issues with the German cars, I still like them better than the Japanese cars as far as looks and the way they drive. But as far as reliability and cost of ownership, nothing is better than the Japanese. My wife and I want to start a family in a couple of years, so most likely we will not be getting anymore German cars because of the possible extra cash flow that we will have to spend to keep them. We decided that whatever our next car we are going to get, it would have to be Japanese. I'm not saying that the Japanese car that we will get is going to be trouble free. I'm just going with the odds that it will be trouble free.We just went to an auto show to see and sit in the beautiful cars. I still would rather get a German car, but I will have to get a Japanese car because we plan to keep it for a while. If I had $100,000, could spend it on any car to live with for the next 7 years, and pay for all maintenance and cost of ownership, it would have to be the Audi A8L. Simply, it was the most beautiful car there that can sit five, carry a lot in the trunk, had a strong engine, and turn heads. Unfortunately, I live in reality, so we will have to get a Lexus as our next car.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm looking for a good used car, which I will purchase between June and December. I'm looking at these three: 2004 Audi A8L, 2004 Lexus LexusLS, and 2005 Acura RL (all will most likely be certified). I love the a8 but worry about the quality. The LexusLS is nice but kind of bland looking. The RL looks a little bit nicer than the LexusLS and has AWD, which I like. Which will be the best for my money, since I plan to keep it for 5-6 years?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm not disagreeing with you. I'm just saying theSClass, 7Series, LexusLS, A8 and some others are better cars. The reality that the Q45 doesn't sell, even in it's 1st yr, is a testament to that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm not saying that all non Lexus vehicles are shop hogs. The cars that compete specifically with the lsthough, particularly the 7 and A8, are not exactly known for setting the world on fire when it comes to reliability. A friend of mine's '04 Audi A8 needed a new engine. It was in the shop for weeks. Some people are willing to accept that, I'm not. My daily car has to work, 24\7, 365. Who but the lscan say with 100% certainty that they can do that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm not sure what exactly you have against diesels, but they'll have a following in the market right along with hybrids. Hybrids are more popular because people are being fooled by the MPG estimates on the window stickers, but then reality sets in when they don't make the same numbers or even get close. There hasn't even been a real diesel push yet in the U.S. by any of the German luxury brands and Mercedes doesn't even advertise the E320 CDI that much because they aren't yet able to sell it in NY or Cali which are two of their biggest markets. If all the hurdles are cleared and a 50 state diesel is possible MB, BMW and Audi will sell diesels in good numbers. I know Mercedes will, wanna place a gentleman's bet on it? The only hybrid that I know of that is in constant demand is the Prius all the others seem to range from ok to not selling well. I still don't see the point of a GS450h when the GS460 is going to cost likely less with more power. To have a GS450h to save a few gallons of gass with a much smaller trunk than the already too small trunk of the GS430? Doesn't really make sense to me. Then there is the fact that Lexus will only sell 2K units a year, hardly enough for any other luxury maker to take the GS450h seriously. Now the LS600h may be a different story, but the SClass obviously has nothing worry about nor does the 760Li, but the LS600h does make an interesting alternative to the SClass/750Li. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm not sure what you are trying to tell me. We seem to agree that most Lexus owners appreciate perfomance auto's in addition to luxury autos. I also agree that now and in the past, many luxury car owners also had a perfomance car. I remembe when MB cars were considered a perfomance sedan in the 70's when Cadillac/Contenintal was still king of the road and truly floated like a boat. In fact there were very few large sedans in America at that time that could compete with a 450 SEL or SE. I don't know where the 250K base comes from or why it would matter especially with leases as popluar as they are. When the lsfirst appeared (they were termed Near luxury) a lot of previous MBZ & BMW owners started buying them, one of the reasons they would give at the time was ""We saved 30K"". This was not a reference to their ability to afford the additional 30K, but that they got everything they wanted/required in the lsand they didn't spend the additional 30K, on theSClass.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I understand your points and agree with them but I think the prestige factor is narrower than ever and lessening every year. I don't buy a car for prestige so I couldn't care less about it anyway. But by the time 2007 rolls around there will be one or two $100K Lexus cars and the $100K lswill probably hurt the SClass a bit but more so the high-end SClass's. I think you will see some dynamic things with the worldwide launch. This is genearlly a conservative compamy except when it comes to something large. Then it morphs, becomes risky and makes a big splash ala 1990. This worldwide launch will be much bigger then 1989/90 with a lot of press, ads and razzle dazzle and I'm sure its well co-ordinated and planned with surprises. My dealership is adding a satellite dealership 20 miles away because from what they told me is there is a general planned dealership expansion program coming for 2006/7. So there is one for you right off the bat.But in cars above say $55K I'm not sure the numbers are all that different and I'm estimating here so none of this is for certain. But here's my guess as rounded: LS- 30k, LX - 11k, SC14K Total Lexus 55K; MB - SClass 22K, SClass 14K, G-class 2K and E500 - 20K (guessing there is a 2:1 ratio on the E), Total MB 56K. So in outright comparative vehicle figures the numbers are relatively close. Now you have a whole bunch of niche MB's that I have'nt counted because I have no idea of those sales figs. But they are niche and can't be all that great. The other thing to consider is Lexus introduced the GX and many of them are in the $50k range so right there is about a 35k volume seller at a desirable sale price that wasn't there 2 years ago and Lexus has moved up the average price of the RX and LexusES significantly in the last few years - not by raising prices but by outfitting them with more options. They did this very successfully with the lsin 2001 when they rolled the NAV/ML into a package that was practically irresistable. So in the mid 90's you had basically all premium lscars at $56K whereas today you have few premium cars and most are optioned heavier and sell at $62-66K.they also moved up the price of the LX from $55-57K in the late 90's to generally $65-70K today. Unit sales were always around 12K so the GX hasn't even cannibalized the LX. Another big success story on both counts. I think the next LX is a $75k suv for the most part and $80k with the inevitable hybrid.All of this is only relevant at the sales dollar level anyway. It's profit that drives everything and Lexus unit cost to build is far lower than that of MB. It's really something what they've done. In 1995 my LexusLS had a $56K sticker and was simply a premium car. I didn't take the nakamichi and other goodies until 1998. That same car today is virtually unchanged in price, is built better than ever and gives you a lot more standard equipment - more air bags, a more powerful engine, better grade leather with all around seat heaters, skid control (vs outdated traction control back then) etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm reading this about the a8 and LexusLS and it's hilarious for the most part but seriously why do you think eveyrone leases? There has been an extreme contradition on this thread from the start. One minute one of the ls's biggest virtues is that it cost less than theSClass, 7Series, or A8, yet in the same post it will be said that they all cost about the same. Which is it? Every one doesn't lease and for cash folks the difference in price does make some type of difference. The average lsdoesn't even sell (62-64K) for what a A8, 7Series or SClass stickers for, yet this doesn't make a difference? Come on now. ?M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm sorry OAC, but I remember you saying the same thing about the GS300/430 when it was first shown, how there will be some last minute change in order for Lexus to dominate. Ditto with the GS450h. Ok they're saying ""over"" 430hp, so maybe 435-450 at best, that won't be ""V12-like"" performance at Mercedes-Benz. Yeah BMW and Audi (sorry guys) will have something to contend with in a straight line, but the outgoing SClass was a 4.2-4.4 sec 0-60 car, not 4.7-4.9, not sure where you got those numbers. You really can't go by the official numbers on most German maker's website as crazy as that sounds, they're almost always conservative. 430hp especially doesn't compare to 510hp and the SClass will still likely have the torque advantage at 612lb-ft. We'll see, but I doubt anything else will change with the car other than a finalization of the hp numbers which aren't likely to go up much. They have to balance all this power while trying to get the right MPG numbers not an easy thing to do. Turn down the hp and give up performance to the competition and run the risk of making the car pointless next to the LS460, or turn up the hp and kill the MPG numbers in order to give comparable performance to a V12. The engineering in play here is unearthly for sure, I'll give you that. I can see a good number of SClass/750Li/A8 intenders being interested in this car no doubt, it is still impressive though I expected more. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm sorry to hear that, honestly. I know how annoying an intermittent problem can be with a car.....especially when the dealer is not helpful. Don't scream at me when I suggest this...lol. Have you ever thought about letting them keep the car for a few days to see if they can duplicate the problem? Of course mileage and some other details would need to be worked out so they don't just have a field day with your car. What I meant by the SClass being balanced is that you can get whatever you want on it, and whatever you don't want. That level of customization combined with a lighter car than the previous edition was quite a feat imo. Yes the old car had the build, but on features it wouldn't have survived once all these newer cars came along. ljflx, I don't think you're ""wrong"" overall, but its the panic like talk on this board that gets me. You and others (at times) act like a Lexus has never, ever had a single problem. Seeing a mirror fall out of a door is not a normal thing on any car, especially a Benz. Not by a long shot. Once you hear certain things over and over about quality declining you'll believe it and look for every little thing you can find to underline this point. Yes there has been a quality decline at Mercedes-Benz, no argument from me there, but this hysteria about Benzes constantly being on the side of the road has gotten ridiculous. If someone tells you a story about a house being haunted, you'll be convinced of that the minute something happens in that house. Things that could happen in any house, or car for that matter. This talk like no one with a Benz or any other ""European"" car as you put it, having a good ownership experience has just really gotten as tired as all the raving about leather/wood/sound systems to me. Mercedes stop building cars that way because basically their traditional ""overbuilt"" or over engineered way of doing things weren't appreciated by enough people to make the business plan viable anymore. Mercedes made all types of advances in their cars, things that other makers, save except Volvo, were still ""researching"". To really appreciate a Mercedes you have to see the guts or ""saw it in half"" as they say. The company has had to go through a many changes and change priorities due to the Japanese entering the market and secondly the need to sell more cars. When cars like Lexus come along with a fancy wooded interior and killer sound system people could care less about the engineering aspect of the car, as long as it works. This is what Mercedes must either make reliable or change. A very tough spot to be in. I personally am not impressed with all the wood/leather/sound systems that Lexus partially makes their case with. I like the more technical aspects of a car. A car like a ES330 or LexusLS are no different in theme (not execution) from a Avalon or Camry. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm through with the RL. It was never competitive with an SClass or 7Series on any level other than being a car with 4 wheels. Nothing will convince me otherwise and unlike the RL, the S320 made up to 40 percent of SClass sales during 1992-1998, in other words it sold, something the RL has never done. Furthermore the S320 was but one SClass model you still had the option of getting a S420, SClass or SClass during the W1240SClass' production run. With Acura you had no choice. ""Every single criticism you worked up against RL applies to MB of the mid-90's too. Mainstream MB cars were always ""heavy tanks""; even the SClass of that era faired poorly in latter crash tests (contemporaries were not as obsessed with barrier crash tests as we are now).""What? You're kidding right? Absolutely not true at all. Mercedes-Benz was crash testing their cars against barriers when the others weren't doing much of anything. Who in the world do you think pioneered the whole offset crash barrier process and came up with the crumple zone concept that every single carmaker today uses??? Please show me the data in which the 1992-1999 SClass failed any crash test. I'll be eagerly awaiting your results. You're the only one that thinks the E320 is outdated, which I find to be ridiculous and not based on anything factual. The engine in the E320 does the job and does it well. No? See the last C&D comparo of the E320, GS300, 530i, A6 2.7t, S-Type 3.0 and M45. ""Do you realize that RL is getting an upgrade even before 2006?Do you realize that it is about darn time? The car has been the same for 9 model years! Talk about not being competitive. ""When Lexus put out the new SC430, it didn't even bother making an SC300 version. Lexus has the meat of the entry-mid luxury market taken care of with the ES300/330 and RX300/330. MB's offerings in that segment, the E320, E320 wagon and ML320/350 have been losing sales to Lexus in dramatic fashion.""You're confused on market segments. The E320 doesn't have a chance at 48K of outselling the ES330/TL nor does it compete with it them 33K. It is beyond ridiculous to even suggest such a thing. I'll give you the the ML isn't even close to being competitive with the RX, no argument there. The GS300 ain't gonna do squat against what will be the 260+ hp E350 by early next year.

"I've been around - I got back from Chicago on Thursday - but I'm staying out of the merry-go-round discussion on the Lexus vs. MB board this time. Some Saturday this summer I'll get around to a local dealer that sells RR's and Audi's. It's where I tested the old A-8. I'm actually interested in taking a look at the new RR. I did think the paint job on the A-8 I saw at the auto show was the best I've ever seen on a car. Audi doesn't skimp on anything in/on the A8 - that is for sure.Everyone of these cars is up to auto excellence standards and I can't imagine that anyone of them will disappoint the buyer if bought for his/her desired automotive reasons. I've gotten used to great reliability so I'm spoiled by it. The fact that Lexus lsdelivers the ride and quietness I love coupled with that reliability leads me back there.I think autospies is 50% guess and 50% real on facts. I'm interested to see how accurate they are with the 2004 lsredo they talked up a while back. I did read it there first and it was quite a while before anyone else picked it up. By the way I'm curious as to what you thought of the GS redesign they showed. I thought it was a great looking car.Lastly - where is the A8 redesign in the mix of S,LS,7 and A8? Is it first and in the lead or last and catching up. I always thought it was in the lead on the redesigns followed by MB, Lexus and BMW. If that is the case than you have to measure it vs. the redos of the other 3 as they come out. One great thing about the A8 is its scarcity. With only 2k a year sold here you are rather unique on the road when you drive one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I've been gone for a couple of days but have returned to the same old chatter; the lsis superior, all else is obsolete. Such blasphemy.Now the lsis the top-performer, (Lexus)the best builder(hardly), and outshore MB?? I find this interesting as a few pages ago so many LexiIthinkIcan's were preaching of how the lswas just a crusier and a smidge better than Caddy. And now jealousy has entered the mix? Jealous of a car that is one tie-rod end bushing from from meeting the ground in turns? Jealous of a car that is so incredibly unclued about how it wants to operate? The Euro suspension? Go and find the 1800 cars that have been sold through '01 to see if it can scratch a S/7/A8/XJ/QP/?? Moreover, jealous of a car that wants to be German so bad it went and got a horribly done plastic surgery job to fit in more? Jealous of unknown identity? I THINK NOT!Like Merc mentioned, if Lexus can't win, it's not noteworthy. The I-hate-too attitude of the Lexicans proves that we g-carfans dance to our own beat....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I've been waffling a long time now on leasing or purchasing a new vehicle. Recently I decided on leasing a luxury vehicle, which ironically is where I started.In re entering the leasing market it is clear that some of the standard price considerations don't apply especially if you plan on turning over the vehicle at lease end. For instance, a 7Series can be leased cheaper than an a8 given the lower residual on the Audi despite the higher MSRP on the BMW. The same is true in comparing a XJ-8 vs. LexusLS.Next is research will only get you so far. I'm not debating JD powers, intellichoice or our host Edmunds...but does everyone always agree on appearance or ease of operation? Several days ago I drove a 7Series that was unprepped and not programmed. My impression was that it was indeed deep in complicated technology but for me the layout was intuitive and reasonably laid out. Maybe for those of us who own planes or boats certain types of technology are less daunting. Interestingly anyone who thinks auto technology and the landscape of the cockpit won't change will probably be disappointed. Someone recently commented that ""rich businessmen won't buy a car that requires a teenager to drive."" I don't know about anyone else but my teenagers are growing up quick. I recently saw a auto mag with ""auto's of the future."" The layout doesn't even resemble a present day car, in fact there was no obvious gearshift and no foot pedals! So much for easily accessible audio controls.The point I'm getting to is that major changes in technology seem to meet a lot of resistance. BMW took a lot of heat for a vehicle that may turn out to be the link between the auto of today and tomorrow. If guilty, their mistake was releasing the technology before perfected and maybe before we were ready for it. The whole situation reminds me of other areas of technology where people focused on the downsides and resisted change. What office still functions efficiently without faxes, computers, DSL...With the above said I am leaning towards the 7Series but felt compelled to write this given the expectation the 7Series was poorly conceived and designed. For the record other vehicles driven included the SClass, A8L, XJ-8 and the venerable ls(seemingly this boards favorate...please let's not review the reliability issue again).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm going to surprise you here and agree with what you're saying in general, but another part of my point was that when you look at BMW and MB they aren't as staid and rigid as Lexus either. They offer more choice, and I don't mean just AMG/Motorsport vehicles. (The new M5 isn't on sale here yet so if they are selling any they are just left over last generation models.) Even basic MB and BMW models aren't as detached as a Lexus is. Cars like the LexusES, RX and ls(which define the brand and are their consistent big sellers) are about supreme and total isolation. A 7Series Sport or SClass Sport does at least, at the very least offer some sort of pretense of being sporty compared to a LexusLS even with its ""Euro"" option. Of course the BMW delivers on the premise, and SClass Sport is just a little sharper to drive, but still not on the level of the BMW. I mean lets pretend I was a Lexus devotee for a second. I know its hard to grasp something like that but bear with me for a second. After I move up from a GS to a LexusLS, then what? A SC430, that drives more or less like a ls? Then what? With MB and BMW you could spend nearly a lifetime buying their products and still not have owned someting in each of their respective model lines. Ljflx says that keeping it simple is the key to profits just as Lexus is set to expand their number of choices greatly over the next few years. I mean all I read is about the many variants of the next lsand IS. If Lexus does do a IS Sedan (a given), Coupe and Convertible, plus a tuner version aren't they doing the same thing BMW is doing? Now is that too many models? Or is it ok because Lexus will do it? If they have 3 variations of the next lsis that not expansion ala Mercedes-Benz's practice inSClass? Too many contradictions there. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I've read pages and pages of messages on here and the back and forth regarding ""the lsrules"", and ""the lsstyling is a knock-off of BMW"".When I first saw the pics of the LexusLS, I immediately thought ""BMW 7Series"". Except (to me) it looks a little better than a 7. But the styling IS derivative, and if my first reaction is the same as many others, it can't be just a ""coincidence"".The thing is, I don't get why it's that big of an issue on this board. Lexus will sell a ton of them. And they'll do it because the Lexus is at least as good as the BMW and MB, and $15k-$20k cheaper (probably). But you know what? Hyundai is doing the same thing at the bottom end of the market to the Japanese. The Sonata has been getting better and better, to basically equal the Japanese competition in quality & reliability, while maintaining a significant price advantage.Face it, not everyone (or even most people) that buy a BMW 7Series do it because it is a driver's (or ""performance"") vehicle. They do so because it is big and luxurious and has a good name. And guess what? That's the same reason a lot of people will buy a Lexus. Add ""less expensive"" and ""more reliable"" into the mix, and you can see why the lsis a compelling option, not just for SClass buyers, but for 7Series buyers as well.Fair disclosure: I drive an Audi (an A3, mind you, not an A8, which my budget will not yet allow for), before anyone accuses me of being a ""Lexus-lover"" or something like that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I&#146;d be curious to know what regional sales are like with these cars. With all the talk around here about Audi these days I&#146;ll say one thing, a lot of their sales must be around the NY area because I see them all over the place. Another thing I have noticed is driving habits of people in HELMs and find it quite to my satisfaction. I rarely get annoyed by any HELM driver. Surprisingly, I find that lsdrivers keep a good pace and are even quite aggressive with speed. The A8 drivers seem to be the most aggressive and the car has a beautifully solid athletic gait. I was once tooling along over the GW Bridge at about 70 and a guy in a dark blue LexusLS came blasting past me doing about 95 and on the cell phone. I was thinking I hope he doesn&#146;t have to change lanes in that thing or he&#146;ll wind up in the river. I was also wondering if it was Ljflx but then I said nah, Ljflx would be talking on the cell and reading the WSJ at the same time. Yeah, I know, you have Bluetooth and get your news online but I had to slip that crack in ;-) Tagman? sounds like your stoked with Elise, kind of like having to climb Mt. Everest. That top is another thing I would have no patience for. Weather permitting my top is always down and it gets a workout depending on where I am going and parking? up down up down. Have you ever considered an S2000? That was my second choice. The car is brilliant and the second generation interior is gorgeous, not to mention it is the steal of the sports car lot. It&#146;s just that the Boxster S is the decathlete, the best combo of sport and comfort. Cargo space is also important to me. Plus the Boxster is a long range cruiser where the S2000 starts to get testy.Tagman, let me ask you something. I need a good workgroup printer and have been out of touch with them the past couple of years since a lot of our work goes outside and my personal comping box has been an Epson 3000 which yields gorgeous prints but is painfully slow and tempermental. The demands are different now and such a printer doesn&#146;t cut it anymore. Is Fiery still the printer of choice or can you recommend the latest and greatest? It has to take orders from both Macs and PCs plus postscript? also print 11 x 17 full bleeds, even larger on a 13 x 19 sheet. Thanks.Hpowders? ready for the modern-day massacre at Winged Foot? I am four miles away and will try to get there this week. I heard it will be the toughest Open ever and that&#146;s the course to do it on with its length and small crowned greens. We&#146;ve had a lot of rain and the rough is not only long but hearty. New York has great Open courses in WF, Shinnecock and the unique Bethpage Black. Although the last one at Shinnecock was a little ridiculous with the potluck speed of the greens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If I'm imagining the tailamp issue (on a car you haven't yet seen right?) then surely you're surely imagining that a Ford is the cause of any thoughts among European carmakers, especially Mercedes.....and surely your theory about the Cadillac Sixteen is even more baseless. You haven't even seen the 04' LexusLS in person yet right? What you got from a conversation with someone is oh-so important and more importantly true, but nobody else is allowed to draw any conclusions about something they can actually see. For the record I see one Benz owner saying anything different from what I said, unlike more Lexus fans who don't seem to be in as big a state of denial. DonFenn, You stated that you thought the XJ was faster than the S55, and I said that the XJ would get smoked in that reguard and it does. ""I wish that some people would look at the stats, before overstating their opinions."" Thats exactly what you should have done. The facts: Mercedes-BenzSClassAMG: 493hp, 516lb-ft of torque, 0-60 mph: 4.6 secs. Jaguar XJR: 390hp, 399lb-ft of torque, 0-60 mph: 5.0 secs. These are purely from MB's and Jaguar's websites. The XJ has actually been tested by Road and Track and it took 5.1 secs to get to 60 mph, the currentSClasshas yet to be tested, but if the similarly powerful SClass is any indication theSClasswill do the same feat in about 4.4 secs or faster. Lets not even discuss grip, and passing and 1/4 mile performance, the Benz will crush the cat. Performance wise the XJ is indeed toast. The only area the XJ might outperform the Benz is in braking, due to it's brilliantly light (lighter than the A8 too) construction. That said it's still a great car and a bargain compared to aSClassor 760Li, but those cars do outperform it. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm on a different page than you with the 95 and 98 lscars. I thought they were both excellent updates of the original car. I preferred both to the 1990-1994 cars. From my view the redesigns replaced the boxy look of the original car with a sleeker more aerodynamic look but still maintained its overall style. As well I see Lexus quality equal to or even higher than the early 1990's. The 2004 is built like a tank and even the glovebox sounds like a bank vault when you close it. I also find the SC, GS, GX, LX and RX have incredibly high build quality. I can't speak for the IS and LexusES as I have hardly been in them. Designman - 9 perfect years and 250,000+ perfect miles makes you stay loyal to a brand. It's that simple for me plus I love the design of the 2004 ls- in and out - and the ride, build quality and engineering even more. Its the same reason MB owners stayed so loyal to their cars for so many years. They delivered perfection or near perfection as well in the past. That's why I already have so much confidence in the 2007. I have no doubt it will be a beautiful car with meaningful general improvements over the 2004 model and a groundbreaking fuel technology that will be highly desired to boot. Hey - a bunch of owners are looking forward to a car that is three years out. That speaks volumes about the quality and equity of the brand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm sorry, but I really have to agree with Merc's posts here. I think Lexus' idea of ultimate luxury is to be as simple and hassle free for the owner as possible, from interfacing with the car to the dealership experience. Cars like the LexusES, RX, and lsreflect that, and all have done very well. None of them are or have ever been sports cars though. The LexusES is no match for aCClass or A4 in terms of driving dynamics. The RX will get beaten silly by an Infiniti FX or BMW X5, and the same will happen to the LexusLS by the likes of a Maserati Quattroporte or BMW 7. Lexus knows that LexusES, RX, and lsbuyers are interested in simple, quiet, luxurious and trouble free cars first and foremost, and they know exactly how to sell to those people. Nobody can beat Lexus on their home turf, but when Lexus tries to move onto BMW or Mercedes back yards, they always have trouble. They have limits for noise and ride quality that they wont go past, and that always ends up being detrimental to ultimate handling potential. The M3 or M5 will beat you up on a rough road, and Lexus wont make a car like that. The GS430 must contain a certain level of softness in order for it to have what Lexus considers to be the desirable traits of a car with the L badge on it. Infiniti has no built in ideals in its badge that it must adhere to, so they are free to make the wonderful, hard-charging M45 that is all sport, no excuses, and Japan's only real threat to BMW.-Edit, yes I know for now the GS is leading the M in sales, but take a moment to consider the fact that Infiniti is the company nobody ever heard of until 2003. The GS had a 10 year head start on the M, 12 if you dont count the embarrasing first M45. Lexus would be mighty red faced if Infiniti actually beat them with M sales.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've never been an LexusES fan but I also find the new LexusES to be a bolder and a much better looking design from any of the past cars. The wood trim on the old car was too much LS-like and almost seemed out of place. Agree with Lexusguy that the nav is now a seamless fit as oposed to an awkward looking postage stamp paste on in the past model. Overall to me the car is a big improvement from the old design.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If RL were the core of Acura business, the company would be in serious trouble. The matter of the fact however is that Acura would do just fine even if not a single RL is sold this month or next. E on the other hand is bread and butter of MB (well, in the prestigeous past anyway, before C took over the bulk of sales). Both E and C are being heavily discounted, and both are actually newer than LexusLS and ES330; the Lexi have not even bothered with engine/badge updates like MB has since their model introduction years ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
If they intend to rival the S and 7 with the GS where on earth are they going with the LS?? To the stars?That car looks and sounds awesome. That will be the last of any MB style copying we'll hear around here. Also is the HPX then slated as an upscale RX. That one confused me.It will also be very interesting to see what they do with the LX and how hybrid technology will affect gas mileage and power in that thing by 2006 or 2007. I guess I will lease the 2004 as the new developments at Lexus will be huge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"If Mercedes isn't THE technology leader, then they certainly are among the top 2. The other being BMW. Electronics, such as CD changers are hardly ""technology"" as most people understand the word. It's the brand culture that keeps/kept Mercedes/Porsche and other German makes from installing these things, not that they couldn't. I know you realize that. Lexus doesn't make it's own stereos, neither does Acura. In short if Mercedes felt that these things were so important they would have done it years ago. You have to remember these are German companies and they're still a little stubborn. European companies have never place emphasis on things like stereos, cupholders etc, and it hasn't hurt them nearly as some would like you to believe. Technology is electro-hydraulic brakes, active suspension, radar-based cruise control, folding hardtops, all of which Mercedes did first, all of which Acura doesn't even offer. Acura only compares to Mercedes in two areas, quality and reliabilty. Other than that Mercedes wipes out Acura with the first turn of the key. ""That's why the new SL500 comes with a complete back-up mechanical brake system.""Do you think BMW, Lexus or any other company that will introduce this technolgy (BMW is next) won't have a backup system in place? It would be foolish and totally un-Mercedes for Mercedes not too. Electronics are not perfect in any car, including the Japanese ones. Yes they are better at it, but they too have problems....admittedly not as often. About Mercedes' SBC I haven't heard about it failing on the SClass or EClass as of yet. The ABC active suspension technology works brilliantly too, as advertised. I see you're going off into the best factories and the best this and that. Well, our initial conversation was about which cars have the most advanced technology. That would be Mercedes-Benz or BMW. Specifically, the SL, CL or 7Series. Period. For better of for worse they are miles ahead of anything produced in Japan. America has nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing worth mentioning. A 1995 Legend was a good car, no doubt, but I can find plenty of cars from just about any brand in good shape that spent most of their life in Georgia. Now lets talk about all EClass LexusES I see around here (Chicago) that look brand new. Now just the 1996-2002 models either, I'm talking about the 1986-1995 E also. Ever noticed which cars don't have damage after a hail storm? It's usually Volvo and Mercedes, thicker sheetmetal and better paint will do the trick everytime. Acura doesn't ""build"" a car the same way Mercedes does. If you don't believe me about Mercedes' longevity, just take a look at a used car lot that sells foreign cars. You'll find the Mercedes there in better shape than all the rest. A Mercedes can be driven to hell and back and return for more. Hondas suspension is usually shot much earlier as is the intergrity of the body. I'm not knocking Acura at all, but Mercedes is just more car. A 1990 Legend was a good car, but a 1990 300E was better still, no matter which way you want to look at it. I seem to remember a C&D comparo in 1986 between the Legend, 300E, and Seville, needless to say the 300E won that test hands down. The Japanese do not lead the Germans when it comes to in-car technology, only quality and production methods. I'll readily admit that the Japanese as a whole produce the highest quality cars on earth, yet for all of that European cars are more popular than ever in this country. That would lead me to believe that either the Japanese quailty/reliability arguement is loosing steam (i.e. isn't *always* what its cracked up to be) or that all these European cars aren't so bad after all. I'm not going to get into the E vs LexusLS, lsvs S debate again, we've done that a many times before in this thread and others. All I'll say to that is the CR doesn't mean squat to the enthusiast who isn't about to buy something they don't want because they say it's more reliable. ""But it is the most reliable, dependable, available and therefore durable car ever made."" That remains to be seen, sure it's relaible and dependable, but durable, that will be determined years from now. From what I've seen 1990sSClasses are the most durable cars made. Pure reliabilty will always be the domain of the Japanese. nealm1, I'm shocked! ljflx, A few exceptions to your post. Have you not read about all the transmission problems Acura/Honda owners are having as of late? Have you not seen the cheapish interiors on the newer Nissan products? From the Altima, G35 to 350Z, all cheap, hardly the pillar of quality. Have you not seen some of the more recent surveys, they indicate that cars like the Toyota Camry has ""gone south"" as you say. The Americans are doing much better, again going by surveys as most Japanese car fans like to do. You're giving the Japanese as a whole too much credit. The only company I'm convinced that really does have a superior quality reputation is Toyota, and they aren't perfect. Read some of the Honda and Nissan topics here and tell me they are head an shoulders above all the European brands. Only VW comes to mind as being any worse. ""I also have no faith in MB's drive by wire."" Care to explain that one to me? Drive by wire? Throttle, steering, brakes what? Drive by wire has been on various German cars since 1990. Your lack of faith is sorely unfounded. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If you're going to compare a Euro LexusLS, you should compare it to a SportSClass, otherwise the comparison is not truly of alike cars, and isn't fair. The SClass in the C&D comparo had ABC on top of the regular ""Sport"" package. I would just get a sport model, I wouldn't order ABC on aSClass, it's too expensive. BTW, I got a chance to finally see the Phaeton. I saw a rather large car sitting in the VW dealers showroom, so it could only be....My Prediction: The Phaeton won't make it. VW's sales mentality won't cut it with a 88K (W12 model on the floor) car. The salesman that were present were telling everyone to schedule an appointment to see the car, and wouldn't even open it....even for the older (older than me) people there that looked able to buy such a car. The car itself looks ok, though it might be a little on plain side. The A8 definitely looks a lot better. Most people will either like or hate the stretch, upsized Passat look. VW's dealer body simply isn't ready for this car. If you get a chance check one out and let us know what you think. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ihave purchased a 2002 ls-u/l with 4ooo miles.this is a rare find.bought from an estate sale,the dealer kept me from going to mb to sniff around.i bought the car for 58k from the dealerwith 5.25% financing.lexus somtimes makes it hardto rear off to another brand name.the lexus financing is easy to hop on since they can playwith the big boys in % numbers.so far this car isflawless except for the goodyear tires that need to be replaced at 35k miles",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If Mercedes' gains aren't ""as impressive as they seem"" then neither are Lexus'. This is why I don't get into sales too much here because Mercedes' sales are analyzed to death and there is always some type of implied problem no matter what they do, yet Lexus is in the same exact boat yet there isn't any implication of a problem there, only with MB. Lexus' SUV sales are dead in the water as is the lsand the GS is also declining vs. last year which leaves the new LexusES and IS as the only bright spots. Saying that old IS was a extreme dud really doesn't make much difference. At least Mercedes got a boost last month from two existing models, the SClass and SLK. The latter of which hasn't been face lifted or anything showed a big increase for May 06'. EClass which posted a healthy gain last month hasn't even seen the 07's hit the ground yet. So expect a big increase there also. Question is does Lexus have any model that hasn't been replaced or updated posting any sales gains like Mercedes does?? It *seems* you're basically knocking (however subtly) MB for posting a gain based on new models being largely successful (except the R) which is what is supposed to happen when new models are introduced. What was that a while back about ""replenish mode""? Just like Lexus' SUVs are declining while they concentrate on their cars, Mercedes cars will now start getting the attention because all of the SUV models are in place now. The new S is obvious, the updated E arrives next month and the new C is less than a year away. What more can they do? Lexus is more or less, probably more so in the same boat my friend. Fact is that neither MB or Lexus would be posting gains this year without new or facelifted (in the case of MB) models. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If you need a little bit of both I doubt you will find it in either the LexusLS andSClass. They're not known for sportiness.But the best balance of luxury and sport can be found in the midsize luxury performance sedans segment. This includes the Acura RL, Cadillac STS, Lexus GS300/GS430, Infiniti M35/M45, BMW5Series, Audi A6, Lincoln LexusLS, Jaguar S Type, and Volvo S60.I also doubt that a loaded new LexusES and a used loaded lswould have a similar price, I'd expect a $5K-$10K discrepancy.Prices for those cars range from $40K-$60K, and they're pretty satisfying.Have you also considered a luxury SUV or crossover?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"IMO, the L-Finesse styling concept that Toyota/Lexus has chosen to apply to all of it's current and future models just did not do the upcoming lsjustice. It looks just as insignificant as the current model does in light of controversial designs like the S and 7, for good or worse.As to the Audi's interior, ""overrated"" is a bit overstepping, wouldn't you say? I have yet to purchase or see a car that has this much attention to detail and the use of plush materials as the Audi does. Everything from the suede headliner to the pattern-matching wood is the reason Audi executes the best interior's in the luxo business(altho the low-volume Maserati Quattroporte is a very good alternative).Lexus dropped the ball on more than just not offering the IS350 without a manual. The GS450h, which is supposed to have power of a GS430 with BETTER fuel economy than a GS300. This car weighs 240 pounds MORE than a 430 and only returns 4 mpg better, with a 6k premium on it's price and the added complexity of the HSD technology. How's that for dropping the ball. They did such a good job with the RX400h that I can't understand why goof-up now?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Impressive yes, but not the second coming the automobile as predicted here so many times. As an alternative to the SClass and 750Li I can see why, but compared to the 760 and especially SClass this car still won't have the power to compete, especially with the 510hpSClass. Dr Fill hasn't said a word and both the LS600h and LS460 threads on the future boards are very quiet. I sense a great letdown among a lot of Lexolites. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In August I crossed shopped all of the lux cars recently discussed here. ?Here's my take and final decision: ?XJ- great looking and unique styling. Drove very ordinary, nothing special and interior was dissapointing. ?A8- Liked looks as it's very distinctive as well. All wheel drive is a big plus. Great interior. Only long wheel base was available and it wouldn't fit in my garage. Also, I felt like a limo driver when I looked at the back seat. Didn't feel confident in the quality of electronics just from resarch of the brand. If A6 was out I might have considered as it seems to be similar to A8 SWB. ?MBS 430 4 matic- My favorite in classy looks. On 2 different test drive vehicles there were electronic glitches. Couldn't tilt wheel and one window wouldn't go up! Loved the way it drove. Ruled out for quality issues which I witnessed first hand. ?BMW 745i- I like the styling. Interior was a dissapointment for a luxury car. It drove great but too sporty. If I wanted a sporty drive I would have stayed with my 330 or gone to the 530. Also, didn't want to deal with I Drive and have 2 friends who went lemon law. ?LS430-I decided that for a luxury car this fulfilled 90% of what I wanted. Comfort, reliability, performance re speed which is important to me in merging etc. tech goodies like blue tooth which I use with my cell phone, and reliability. Also, ML was important to me as it's is the absolute best car audio I've ever had or heard. ?In my perfect world the SClass would be as reliable as a the Lexus, have all the tech goodies and cost the same. That car didn't exist so I went with the lsand have been very happy. I also realized that all cars compromise on some aspects. One just has to decide for them what aspects they are and are not willing to compromise on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"IMHO, G and M does better than ""compete well against"" IS and GS. However, LexusES and RX are what makes Lexus such as success. That's where the money comes from to bankroll everything else, just like 3Series for BMW. Infiniti has not quite mastered the art of leveraging its plebian product into something ""desirable"" at significantly high price point, perhaps due to lack of execution in details.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact I'd state that the new SClass should have MORE interest than the new LexusLS. Why ? The new S is the first re-design in like forever (6+ years), so why isn't there a pent-up anticipation for this car ? OTOH, the lsreceived a complete makeover for the 2001 release, and another face-lift for the 2004 release, yet barely 3 years later, Lexus is re-doing it all over again, and the buzz is real strong !!! Hmmmmmm...... I would have thought that the car that needs the redo the most would be getting the buzz... Maybe its that the new S really does not need a re-do afterall... Its current style is already pretty nice, and MB can only worsen not improve an already great style. Maybe they should have left it alone afterall...But with a re-styled 7, A8 and lsin the offing, it makes sense to re-do the S as well... But we'll see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In my town and much of the surrounding area - ls's and SClass cars dominate the large lux driving. Audi's are few and far between. BMW 7's are not all that common but 5's, 3's and X5's are plentiful. TLC's and LX470's dominate the large lux suv landscape. RX's are seen virtually the minute you are on the road. In virtually all cases the drivers are people in their 40's (I know many of them from school activities and other social functions) to early 50's. All of these people will not even blink at that lsre-design and will probably rush to it. I think the Florida crowd may be older simply because of the migration south as we get older. When I'm in Florida I tend to see mainly 55+ drivers of virtually any $50K+ lux car. ? In the sportsworld everything has flipflopped up here. WOR9 is doing Yankee games this year and I think WPIX does the Mets. Yankees have their Yes network and Mets network debuts soon. The Yes network has given George S the money to pursue any and every free agent on the baseball planet. I used to be a diehard Yankee fan but the competitive nature of the game is gone with the greatly disproportionate payrolls. If a team wins the WS with a $125mln+ payroll it should get an asterisk. If Bud Selig wants to get George's ire - that will certainly burn him up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In order to succeed in HELM Infiniti will have to radically reinvent its flagship with 1. Cutting edge technology2. Drop-dead Sleek and Sexy design (much like aston martin rapide)3. Powerful and fuel efficient V8 and may be V10, V12 engines. 3'. Rich and sophisticated interior with beautiful craftsmanship. 4. Maybe a 5% discount over Audi A8, if that. 5. A strong emphasis on Reliability, at top or near Lexus. Offering cut-rate pricing as suggested with a HUGE 25% DISCOUNT OVER ls460, let alone SClass is not going to help at all. it will be equivalent to committing suicide. Remember guys, lowering the price tag in HELM arena doesnt work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In post #11880, Tagman said: One problem I see is that Mercedes tends to offer options and packages at very expensive prices and the overall price tends to escalate very quickly. This is, again, where the Lexus people who look for ""value"" might take a poke at Mercedes. But that is a requirement for Lexus . . . they can NOT be very, very expensive, or they will NOT sell the number of units they need to.There is a misconception here. Most folks buying in the HELM range are not value buyers. A $65K lsis NOT a value purchase. Any car that expensive is not purchased for its *value*. If one needs a value purchase, spend $20-40K and get a wide range of excellent and very capable cars out there. My $15K '03 Matrix is a hoot to drive, and I love it. This is my *value* purchase.... WRT the LexusLS, every iteration release often starts higher in price than the previous version. Same will be expected when the 2007 LS460 gets here next Fall. And with the promised Hybrid (LS600h), AWD (option) and LWB/SWB versions, you can expect these various configurations to start to climb in price as well. Will the lsversions be higher, at par, or remain lower than the comparable MB ?, I guess we'll see soon enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In reading that letter about the 07' LS' pricing on the lsboard, I'd have to say it is a hoax for a number of reasons, IMO. I can't see Lexus or anyone with Lexus using ""whew"" and ""grand daddy"" in an official correspondence. Secondly those prices are just too high for the car to be competitive in Lexus' typical manner, unless Lexus has decided that the 7Series and A8 are no longer competition. I can't see a LS460L going for 94K, which is an LS600hL price if anything. The base price of a LS460L will be 86K, the same as a SClass? No way is that going to happen. Lastly I think it is a little too early for such detailed pricing information to leak out if the car really goes on sale in Sept. Just my take on it. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the cars we debate here on this forum, I want to see rationales for buying any of these carsNeed performance ? Buy a 7SeriesNeed handling ? Buy a 7SeriesNeed luxury amenities ?

Buy anSClassNeed best customer service ? Buy an LSNeed a drag racer ? Buy none of these carsBy my unscientific survey here, the 7Series garners 3 points, SClass has 4 points, and the lshas 4-points. Maybe a honorary mention for the A8 ! See, even this unscientific survey correlates (somewhat) with the sales volume in the US (LS > S > 7 > A8)Need a high-end luxury car ? Buy a Bentley, or a RR. Nothing else beats these two for sheer high-end luxury....So why debate these lower-lux class cars ? Especially seeing that they do not provide all things to all buyers....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the U.S. market, as others have pointed out, the lsoutsells the S by a healthy margin and the A8 by a ridiculous margin. ?Now, if having all those S and A8 variations is so desirable, and if the S and A8 are sooooo much more luxurious than the ls(to the point that they are in a different and higher class entirely, according to you), how could that sales performance possibly happen????",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"IMHO, Lexus was running out of staff with all the core product updates with RX, LexusES, lsplus new products like GX and hybrids. The Gen1 IS was literally a stop-gap measure; Lexus was probably surprised by the rapid rise of BMW (set against the back drop of MB's decline all the more dramatic) just like everyone else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Interesting how everyone can read the same report and come out with different viewpoints !One thing I'd like to know is the timeline that this survey was conducted. BTAIM, the results do look interesting.Styling: The IS was higher ranked than the new e90; conversely, the 7 was higher than the lsand S (new or old style ?). Even the GS/A6/5 were all tied... whowouldathunkdat based on some of the bashing the GS has received here by people like Merc1.Porsche placing 1st makes sense. All their cars are cute and satisfying to owners. Whoever does not like a Porsche, pls stand up and get outta this forum now ! So let's add up the ""scores"" in the individual model performance categories by manufacturer:Toyota/Lexus won 4 categoriesBMW/Mini won 2 categoriesMB won 1 categoryInfiniti/Nissan won 5 categories (how the QX won anything beats me)Audi was a 0-for !Porsche tied for 1 winBTW, the new Camry is selling pretty briskly... the new S is doing extremely well as well, how are these not reflected in their ranking afterall the survey concludes that new models are the best winners ? Clearly things don't appear to be adding up, IMO.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Interesting points, as always. I do think you're looking at from just a hp/price standpoint and I think it will take more than that and a fuel economy edge to crack the market at the high end, especially on a proposed 600hp car. Mercedes has played their hand as far as the SClass and S65, you're right they aren't going to get any cheaper. However we really need to see what the SClass in general brings to the table as far as performance, it could be lighter, better geared or anything...better than the current generation, thus improving its performance also. As far as what a SClass or S65 costs now its the same situation as the LexusLS vs the SClass or the 7Series, on paper the value of the lsshould have stopped the sales of theSClass, but it hasn't far from it. It will be the same thing when this super hybrid appears. Mercedes' isn't going to lose the ability to sellSClasss or S65s just because a Lexus may come close to the performance at a cheaper cost - there is much more to that in this class and especially at these prices. The whole car has to be right and appeal to the enthusiasts buyers that care about 600hp. This is where the current lsalso loses out to the enthusiasts. I hardly see the next lsbeing some great looking car with class leading dynamics, but again that is pure speculation at this point and just my opinion. You mention Scion, I don't see the relevance here. Nissan is gunning for that just like Infiniti is dashing any hopes of Lexus being a sports sedan at least with the GS/M situation so far. I don't think Toyota and especially Lexus can just look at competing with Germans anymore. They'd better watch their back because Infiniti is out to erase any notion of a Lexus being sporty in the entry and mid level sedans sector. Toyota is ahead in hybrid tech for sure, but technology in general I don't think so. BMW, Mercedes, Audi all push that far more than Toyota does by not being scared to introduce it to the market, for better or worse. I'm not talking about just hybrid tech either, which is what you seem to think is more important above all else. Interesting take on BMW. BMW and Mercedes have been competing for years and years and yet Mercedes still holds the card worldwide. Mercedes does and BMW follows. Now that Mercedes has shown the R-Class, BMW has announced a new vehicle (to be know as the V5) to compete. Mercedes did a ML in 1998, BMW does a SUV in 2000. Mercedes is hardly in the shadow of BMW. These two have been complimenting each other in product for the last 40 years and when DCX's MB unit is back to health BMW's small advantage will be gone like it has been all these years. It wasn't until MB got into trouble did BMW pull ahead in some markets, but with their idrive/styling they imo lost the chance to detrhone MB, especially at the upper ranks. Watch this new S blow the 7-Seires away, not hard to do if the 5Series/E-Class situation is anything to go by. BMW is slipping more than you'd like be believe. The 5Series is no longer the segment leader in the press' eyes. Getting beat by EClass at every turn, not to mention the Infiniti M as a ""sport"" sedan. I've never seen a 5Series place 3rd or 4th in a comparo, let alone a brand new 5Series. Yes the 5 is still the drivers car, but the Infiniti has seemed to match that and the A6/E-Class aren't stylistically challenged and the E has all traditional buttons, no idrive. The 7Series had a mess of an introduction. The new 3Series has more competition than every before, even Lexus. BMW's slight advantage on the reliablity charts and sales are their only advantage and at some point Mercedes' product onslaught will catch up with them, imo. Their new styling theme has turned off a many of buyers around the world, but so far they've managed to gain new buyers I guess with certain models, not all. I think if MB feels the heat from Lexus so will BMW they are more or less in the same competitive boat. Especially since Lexus thinks they have a sports sedan in the GS, the IS hasn't been driven yet so the verdict is a long way out on it. Hoever the lack of a manual in the IS350 is big mistake. I can't believe that after the way the previous IS300 hit the floor with a thud because of not having a manual Lexus would do the same thing over again. Here is what I meant by execution as opposed to just saying that Toyota has so much money and can do what they want. All the money in the world is pointless if the execution is off. Everyone else in the IS' segment offers a manual, even stodgy old Mercedes, but they've seemingly decided not to on their top IS model. The GS isn't a 5Series competitor either like Lexus promised. From what I've seen on the GS boards buyers either love or leave it over a variety of issues. Hardly the second coming of the mid-size segment, the Infiniti M beat them too it. I don't see BMW being bought by anyone. The family that owns them, I can't think of the name right now, probably wouldn't go for it unless BMW was in deep, deep trouble. If I'm not mistake I think BMW had one of their best years ever last year? Overall I think between Mercedes, Lexus, BMW and Infiniti the ones that will have the most trouble are Cadillac (already running into price resistance on their XLR and STS) and Acura, the latter which is challenged to get past their entry-level and barely mid-level image. Audi, however hasn't shown their hand just yet, the A8 is only the start. Watch Infiniti and Audi too. Everything isn't hybrids you know. BTW, did you take that trip yet? If so did you rent the 300 or the Pacifica? Really curious to know what you'd think of either. Anway, see you all Monday. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Interesting points, though I question how long the XJ will be able to survive in a more long term field. It already cant match Germany and Lexus on features, and its a brand new car. Jaguar has not shown that they've got what it takes to keep up with the heavyweights, which means 6-7 years max model runs these days. I dont think we'll see a completely redesigned XJ six years from now. If history is any indication, they'll let it sit on the market for 7-8 years, and then refresh it while the rest of the industry passes it by. Jag also cant survive with one competitive model. XK needed a redesign, (and a new platform its THIRTY years old!!) not an air intake. The X-type and S-type need redesigns also.Acura's got a shot, but it depends on how much they are willing to capitolize on their current momentum, and how much Honda is willing to take risks in this market, which they traditionally shy away from. If Acura wants to stay in it, the MDX needs a redesign asap, and the RL is going to need either a hybrid or V8 model. Infiniti and Cadillac are coming out swinging, and the establishment had better pay attention. Past successes doesnt mean they cant get crushed if they rest on their laurels. The A4 is a great car, but one that desperately needs more horsepower. If given the A6's new V6, it could be a much more competitive player. That will still only leave Audi with essentially 2 cars that can actually sell in volume, and the general public's reception to the new A6 is unknown at this point.I honestly dont count Saab and Volvo in the same leagues as the above mentioned. The 9-3 is a luxed up Chevy Malibu, the 9-2X is a luxed up Subie WRX, and the 9-7X will be YET ANOTHER Trailblazer rebadge. Apparently Chevy\GMC\Buick just werent enough versions of the same truck. If the General plans to doom Saab to the same fate as Buick and Oldsmobile, they're sure doing a fantastic job. Ford has thankfully kept more of a hands off approach to Volvo, but they desperately need new product also. The S80 isnt even the worst offender. The C70 is. That car dates all the way back to '97, two years earlier than the S80, and the C70s front end and interior components come from the S70, and even older car, which itself was derived from a still yet even older Volvo. The S40 is a good start, now they need to scrap and redo the rest of the line as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"IMHO:It seems that most growth in the luxury business, has been in SUV's and 'crossover' vehicles.For example 2004 sales at BMW the 3, 5, 7, Z4, X5 are all substantially behind 2003. The new 6 has sold a few thousand cars. The new entry priced X3 is 23,000+ units YTD and the only reason why BMW is showing year over year growth.Lexus on the other hand shows strong growth in the LexusES and lscar lines, as well as the GX and hot RX.At Cadillac, the traditional Deville, Seville car lines fell sharply, while the newer CTS and Escalade/SRX's grew.At Mercedes sales have fallen in the C and SClass cars AND G and M SUV's. The E is up 6% along with some of the niche specialty cars.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Interesting question, as we've discussed this before in this thread. I don't think we'll ever see those models here because of their price relative to the top line V8 versions of the 5Series, A6,EClass, S-Type, and the single car that bridges the gulf in between..the LexusLS. A six-cylinder of the 7Series just wouldn't fly now, neither would an A8. The BMW is way too heavy and Audi has worked very hard to postion the a8 as a premium car, and a 6-cylinder variant would just be a mistake now. I personally would like to see the 735i, S350 and XJ 3.5 V8 on sale here, if only to give more people to truly experience the top car from each of these brands, for a lesser price. Not everyone is caught up on sheer hp. I do think the Benz V6 would have to be spruced up a little to compete with those smaller displacement V8s. I don't think anyone else can pull off a 6-cylinder car in this class now except Mercedes because they were the last to do it. Mercedes in particular shocked a few people by dropping the 6-cylinder SClass from the U.S. lineup, as the old S320 made up 40 percent of SClass sales during some years of the previousSClass' run from 1992-1999. I could see a lot of people choosing a car like these over a LexusLS, the only car that would cover their price point. Of course the Japanese car would have a power advantage, but that would be about it. The price of having the right image is high in the U.S. market as these are seen as ""premium"" cars and thus no sixes or even small eights are deemed worthy. Now if you want to talk diesels, they'll be bringing them as soon as they can! M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Interesting to note regarding the comparo that CR's comparo rated the MB highest, over LexusLS, A8, Jag. They said it was the best riding car they ever tested. It outpointed the lsby small margin and that was mainly for its handling (emergency lane changes etc) where the Lexus scored only average.Of course they don't reccomend the S at the moment due to reliability factors but do report that fit and finish is excellent and rate on a par with the Lexus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In case you did not know, GS400 had a long waiting period in its first model year; so did IS300. They both were hot cars in their first years.

"Is there anyone on this board that has a current model BMW 7Series (for 3+ months) that has not had any severe maintenance issues? I look at the edmunds ratings for BMW (7 specifically, but all models generally) and they seem to evoke either great marks, or really bad marks - especially in reliability. I have read the many horror stories and wonder whether those giving the 7Series high ratings actually owned their cars for any amount of time, or are the 10's in reliability just the first week of ownership excitment, before the trouble really begins. I am looking for an 04 LexusLS, Q, or 7 - the 7 excites me, but the Germans are not really up to par (own 2 MB's) on quality, and BMW seems to enjoy Yugo type quality.

"it is really not that amazing that the one contribution(hybrid advancement) to the automobile that Toyota Motor Company is given credit for is the only one the Lexus crowd wishes to talk about. it seems to me that comparing a long wheel base SClass that is available with 4 different engines, awd or rwd to a short wheel base ,one engine, one drive train Lexus is a bit of self serving. the Lexus myopic should be asking themselves why isn't AWD, LWB, or the choice of different engines available in the car they so love much by the company they so dutifly follow? say what you will about MB quality(because i know you will!) but at least they offer the upscale buyer numerous choices. many of you want to think that comparing the LexusLS to the S's, 7's, Jags, and A8's is an equal comparison but it is not. the Germans and the Brits offer many more configurations and options which in the end affect the selling price. no matter what anyone will post on this board....it is all about price and what people can afford. the people who purchase the LexusLS think they are getting the equivalent of the German offerings when in the end they are buying a nice car that fit their budget. PRICE is everything. same is true when it comes to the hybrids but for different reasons. when it comes to the hybrids it is about the simple economics of the price of gasoline, the miles you will drive, and extra cost of the hybrid vehicle. this differs from the vehicles in the topic of this thread because the RX hybrid and non hybrid are the exact same vehicle...no differences in size, ability, and utility. the cost difference between the two RX's should be scrutinized by each individual buyer to see if the hybrid warrants the price difference. you have to drive a lot of miles to make up the price gap. so compare the SClass to the LexusLS and try to convince yourselves that it is an equal comparison to justify your purchase but realize this.....even the lowest price S is a larger more comfortable automobile with the availability of having AWD if you wish as a no cost option. so when you go"" to show off to the neighbors"" your new S.....let them know about all of the choices that MB made available to you and why the car you purchased fit your needs exactly. then ask yourself....why do so many people who drive Lexus vehicles have the distorted and bitter view that people who drive MB's only do it so they can ""show off to the neighbors""? it sounds like envy and maybe some projection taking place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wow, I never expected a ""welcome back"" from you, means a lot considering the battles we've had. ? Anyway while I don't care anything about Lexus like I do the Euro brands, they are competition and one must always follow the competition's movements. The didn't have the LF-S but I did see the LF-A, and except for the front end the car is pretty good for a Lexus. I especially like the exposed rear cooling fans..pure aggression. They did have the LF-X there too if thats the smaller IS300 hinting concept from last year. I personally found it to be lacking. ? About your friend's choices....me personally without having driven the M35/45 I'd naturally recommend the E500 or the A6 4.2 and then the M45. The Acura TL doesn't play in this league. Did you mean the RL? If so I'd still take the M45 V8 because for the same 50K the Inifniti will run rings around the RL with better styling, more room and the same technology. The only think the RL has over the M45 is awd. I couldn't place the GS due to the look, I personally wouldn't be able to stand looking at it, and the car doesn't appear to getting any changes under the hood of the V8 version. If he wants Euro go for the E or A6, but if reliability is too much of a concern go for the M45...imo the only Japanese car in the segment that is truly outstanding, at least so far. ? I'm glad you liked the show report. ? M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It seems to me that a CAR has no experience at all it is what it is...If it is faster and corners as well and has equal or better acceleration...and what ever it takes to beat the other car...It's esperience means little. We have been discussin Audi and LexusLS..So I have limited my comments to those two cars.The frame of the lsis very solid..Mine is an 01 and is just as solid as it was when I bought it..Many here with lss will say the same about their cars that are as much as 10 or 12 years old.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It seems to me this ""money no object"" theme is getting way off the point. The car mag comparo analogy used by denniswade is much more accurate IMO. The idea is to compare apples to apples and keeping it all in perspective. It's an overall comparison of similar price/features/style/value, etc. That's why Bentley and Rolls and Lamborghini are not in the title of the group. While MB fans tout their heritage and handling, BMW fans talk of their aggressive driving and handling and Lexus fans talk of their luxury and reliability. Obviously, these different features are what attracted each person to begin with. There is, of course, some blending of all these things in each car. What got this off course is the defensive reaction to ""value"" comments made by the Lexus owners (which I admit, I am one). As an LexusLS owner, I not only love my car, I can also appreciate its value compared to the others properly mentioned in this group. I agree with ljflx, all are fine cars. I heavily researched all of them and chose the Lexus for reasons of my own. While I didn't buy it just because it is a better value, I am not ashamed that it is. I do not understand the occasional defensive attitude, esp. from the MB folks, when value is mentioned. It doesn't lessen the quality of my car. It is, in my opinion, an added benefit. I gave up very little to get that added value. I only yield to MB and BMW in aggressive handling, but as someone said, how often do you really drive that aggressively. And if you do, then choose something else. On the other hand, my Lexus is far and away superior in terms of luxury, fit and finish, general quality and at least equal in features. Of course, the style police are waiting to pounce and I can only add that while I agree the MB is styled somewhat better, I do not find the Lexus styling all that bad. To me, it is a total package decision and there are just too many pluses for the Lexus and too many negatives for the others. I would have spent the extra money for something extra. Value was not my first priority, but I am not unhappy that it was included ""free of charge"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Looked at the cars today at the auto show; I love going to be able to compare all the cars at once. Couldn't believe there was no 7Series there. Otherwise I loved the XJL and the A8. I'd take the A8 (I think it's the best looking car both inside and out, especially inside), but with the price diff the XJL comes out ahead to me. One thing I couldn't get over was the $20k premium for an SClass over an XJL. No idea why that exists, other than MB name. And I'm a current MB owner so not knocking MB, just don't see how they charge such a premium over similar cars. Of course this analysis is by looking and sitting, no driving. . .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It still doesn't make a difference if the ls's ""Euro"" option doesn't cost anything because the SClass or SClass is still going to cost more anyway, so whats the difference? You're not comparing cars of equal specification. Thats like me saying the E500 Sport outhandles the regular LexusLS, that simply isn't a fair comparision. I really think you're making to broad of a statement when it comes to the press. They do care about price. Haven't you noticed where a Mercedes gets knocked for costing too much more than it's competion. If not check out the comparo in Road and Track (I think two months ago) in which the SL500 came in forth, behind a Cadillac, Jaguar and a Porsche...due to price. Clearly the car would have ranked much higher if weren't for it's 98K price, the number tally confirms this, as the only place the SClass really got dinged was in the value equation. They even stated that the SL500 was probably the best all-arounder and best car for everyday, in the test. You seem to equate a comparison test with only being a track meet, and that simply isn't so. How can they talk about reliability when they only have the cars for a few days, or a week? In order for them to include that into their deliberations they'd have to keep all 5 cars for a months and months. Not feasible. Their tests are to gauge a cars abilities, and yes they do drive the cars out in the real world. It just appears by the posts in this thread that when they slam an Audi A8 they're so right, but when a Lexus gets knocked for not being anything special to drive they don't know what they're talking about, or at least they aren't being through enough. Thats a double standard. The best example of this is the SC430 vs the segment. Yes I'll wager about the 7Series, because I'll be shocked if such a overcomplicated car wins any of the inevitable comparisions between the new LexusLS, S, A8, and XJ. We should start seeing these next month, I'd say. Seriously, I'd be shocked if it does win, the car is a ergonomic mess. If they put it over simply because it handles better your point will be made, at least with that publication. Also, check out some of the British mags take on the 7Series. (I don't know if anyone here reads magazines like CAR, Topcar or EVO, but I think anyone that doesn't is missing the best automotive writing to be read today.) Anyway, I don't think I've seen the 7Series win yet in one of their tests, its either theSClass, XJ or A8 that come out on top, most of the time. Now I already see the A8 loosing over here, at least in a C&D comparo since they've pretty much said that they don't care much for the car because of it's ride. MT has a comparo of the XJ and the a8 in their Nov issue, btw. I disagree with you on the demographic between the S and LexusLS. They are not the same. Their has to be a difference between the average ls(55-60K) sold and the average SClass (73-85K) sold. There is no way this is the same exact group of people. A lot of people that like the LexusLS are stepping up from GS and RX models and the SClass is hardly ever mentioned due to it's starting price. I realize you can ""take"" a loaded SClass later this morning if you choose, but from what I've seen that isn't the case with *most* LexusLS buyers. No I didn't get to attend the AMG event, it was sold out. There is always next year huh? syswei, You're talking about a car that isn't sold here for one, the S280. Next up, who is doing all the comparing between the LexusLS and the SClass, Lexus is. Lexus is the one billing the LexusLS as the SClass competitor so the imaginary comparison with a S280 is really pointless. It's not Mercedes' fault that Lexus tries to cover two different segments with the LexusLS, which by the way is a wise strategy in most respects. None of the full size luxury cars are the same in price as the LexusLS, not the A8, 7 or S. Only the base XJ is in the same ballpark. My point about the Automobile Magazine award is that the price cutoff it way too low because you can't get aSClass, 7Series or LexusLS for anywhere near 40K. ""There are probably some MB fans who are thinking, ""if they didn't pick the S, Automobile?Magazine's criteria must be flawed""Not hardly, I'd suggest you read back to their 2000 issue in which they picked the SClass for that very same award. Didn't say their criteria is wrong, just that the price cutoff is misleading. sv7887, Now I've said a lot of things, but I don't recall ever saying that the lsis no competition for theSClass, that must be an actual owner saying that. Lets just say that if you think the LS' design is ""original"" I'll just cut this short by saying that I completely disagree with that. I don't see anyone complaining about the LexusLS having an ""overly smooth"" ride. What I do see people complaining about is the control of the body and the handles that results from that compared to a German car. Who is going to complain about a smooth ride if the handling is up to snuff, that doesn't make sense. You're saying that suspension feel doesn't matter? You're kidding right? That is what makes a car ""drive"" the way it does. German cars have this in spades, hence their following. Nobody is saying that any of these cars have ""Indycar"" handling. You're blowing it out of proportion. If feel didn't matter then Lexus owners wouldn't harp about how smoothly their cars ride. In all these cars, from Audi to Mercedes to Cadillac and Infinfi, ""feel"" is what people look for in their first test drive. The ideal ride/handling mix is what will be debated forever, I personally just like Mercedes' take on the question. Just like Jaguar, Audi, BMW and Cadillac have their own definition of this. Styling and design are personal things and it's easy for a Lexus owner to dismiss these as a grip because that is what the car is least good at. Just like MB fans don't see surveys as being the bible. I'm not sure what the ratio is between the SClass and the SClass, since 2002. Now before that, especially upon it's debut in spring of 1999, they sold almost equally. I do know that the previous SClass outsold the S420 by a pretty good margin from 1992-1999. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It was eons ago now (in the time when Merc1 was a staple debater on Edmunds) when I posited that MBs problems run deep and they were not positioning themselves to turn things around. In fact, I recall using the example of the (then) 116-yr-old Barron's Bank (UK) which collapsed due in large part to the unscruppullous workings of a broker in their Asian opperation (derivatives trading). When the dust finally settled on the sordid affair, the bank was no more, despite such a lofty and glorious 100+-year heritage.... Of course, I was chewed up by the MB fans (mostly Merc1) of living in *sales fantasy* and other blah blah blah... I don't want to say *I told you so*, but Len is right. ? Just this past weekend, my friend who owns a 1998 SClass (the tank) told me he will never buy an MB again. This guy was a huge German-car nut (owned a 911 (sold) and a 735i (sold)). Now, he just purchased a 2005 Escallade with the 6L motor; just couldn't justify the additional $15K for the 2005 LX470. He's never owned a Japanese car in his life, but claimed his next sedan will definitely be the LexusLS. His SClass now goes to his 17-yr-old son as his daily driver. Why, I asked ? He told me they just don't build them as they used to. Too many issues with his MB. For example, his rear-view mirror was toast. Cost $1100. Geez !!! ? I guess we'll see how MB makes these adjustments going forward. Hopefully, they come to their senses rather than living off their heritage and brand cache and do something quick. ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It was the S and it stickered around $61k. I could get it at $515 per month with $4k down or $699 per month with 0 down - both for 27 months. I'm at a loss to explain Edmunds TMV pricing on this as they say it sells at MSRP. The $53k GX470 goes for $735 per month with zero down and a 58% residusl after 3 years. Either Porsche has the most creative leasing plans on the planet to preserve MSRP pricing or Edmunds has it wrong. In fact when I added up the down payment, lease payments and buyout I was a tad under MSRP without interest effecting anything. Put a present value stream on those future payments even at a low discount rate and I was well under MSRP. The residual on the Porsche was 70% after 27 months so that's just about in-line with the GX470. Finance is my gig but I don't get this one. I didn't realize the Cayenne had that level of off road prowess.For me - the lsis a certainty. The car is better than ever - tighter than the 2001 base suspension but rides even more silky smooth. The 2004 Euro is also a better handler than the 2001 version. I want to get the Euro though and that is not easy to come by. Lexus is pushing the modern lux package (with or without Euro which is now actually called Sport) or the ultra and doing away with the custom lux per my dealer. If I miss the sport I'll likely go to the ultra lux but that is not till April anyway.I still prefer the LX470 over the GX470 - simply for size and I prefer the LX styling though the GX does ride better. The LX puts the bumps away better but on a highway the GX is the creamier ride. But when you are married you have to make compromises and my wife loves the GX. The alternativve is that I can get the LX but have to get her an RX. No dice on that one. I have my eyes on the SClass based on my personal business developments in a year or so - as the toy car - not an RX . Now about that Boxster. If I'm a single guy like you and don't have to drive every day that's the car I'd save for. Yes its noisy and not the best riding but it is pure sports car, lots of fun and brings me back to my single days. Cars like the SClass and SCdon't do that. They are too mature/grown-up. But the Boxster has to be a weekend/leisure car. I wouldn't want it in a rush hour rain or snowstorm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It would be a great strat for MB to slot the S450 with all wheel drive option against the LS460. The price gap should narrow and that would give MB a very competitive car especially since Lexus doesn't offer all wheel drive option.As for the ""chauffeured feel"", I like that when I'm in the back, I just didn't want to get the ""chauffeuring feel"" I would love to hear a review of your A8 since it has garnered so much acclaim from the media. Are you usually with other passengers or alone? Does it now have bluetooth and satilite? I think when it first came out I was amazed that satellite radio was not an option. What car(S) did you have previously?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's also not true that the A8 has ""everything an LexusLS has and more""...for instance, a backup camera, or a Mark Levinson sound system that has seen rave reviews in true audiophile publications such as The Absolute Sound, or a little refrigerator for the rear passengers. Maybe a little over the top, by YOU are the one who started talking about luxury appointments. If you want to play that game then let's do it:Have you ever heard about 'S'? That's the internal special equipment division of Audi (like AMG for MB and M for BMW). They let you specify everything on your car. If you want to have Mark Levinson sound system (I don't really know why the Bose wouldn't be good enough) they'll put it in. Plus your little fridge...that's a piece of cake! And while you're at it why don't you order the leather in the same color of your wife's favorite dress...But I am sure Lexus will have that next year, so so...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's definitely 2007 but no release date is set. The execs at my dealership think it will be spring 2006 based on their meetings and correspondence with Lexus. Remember also that they are one of the biggest dealerships in the US so they have clout with Lexus. I doubt that most dealerships will share data so easily. My dealer - Ray Catena - will tend to share with long time customers because he also sells MB, Jags etc, so their primary interest is 1 - keep you with Lexus, 2 - keep you with Ray so that if you go MB, Jag ... you'll go with him and not someone else. It's their belief that Lexus doesn't want the SClass to have much of a lead on them in bringing the new edition to market. It's also their belief that the new lswill generate a lot of excitement because of the new hybrid technology it will bring to the market. I've heard largely what lenscap posted through them so there is something strong behind it. But I was told mpg will be in the 35 range and the HP will be north of 400. I don't know if they are coming out with a V12 and I don't care. The hybrid will cause a profound change in this segment.The 2004 is fabulous. The ride is phenomenal and the road feel is tighter than before. The custom lux and ultra lux are even quieter than the other lseditions because of the glass. Hope it doesn't interfere with EZPass. My ex-boss has a problem with his A8 because the windshield glass prevents the readers from picking up EZpass. If you can swing it I'd lease it for 3 years. The 2007 lswill be much hotter than the 2001 was - IMO - so it will be a MSRP or above priced car for a prolonged period. By spring and summer of 2007 the prices will subside. A three year lease starting in April or May positions you well. Lease prices are great right now because lsresiduals are higher than just about any car in this segment and interest rates are low. I'm actually paying $138 a month less than 2001 for a lot more car.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's fair to say that the car should be judged on it's merits. It doesn't happen very often, the RL is one of those times. Great car, but the styling turns to many people off. No snob appeal in driving a 50k car that resembles a mid 20k car.The RL is still a great car in spite of the family heritage IMO. I think the new Lexus is clearly going to be huge seller based on it's merits, and the great reputation that Lexus has earned over the years. The Audi A8 is my choice for cars in this segment, but clearly us Audi lovers are the minority. Unfortunate because this car is truly great but, hampered by reputation. All that to say, the new lslooks like a big ol Camry :P",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's funny that you bring up model year 1998.I had a 1998 LexusLS that I bought on the notion that thing runs forever. I know that the Lexus' are by far the most reliable cars in it's segment, but my experiences with my '98 proved otherwise. Much unlike my beloved '92 that is still running for the owner I sold it to 10 years ago. Let's take a look at what happen to my '98:Transmission failure at only 29,000 miles(4200 repair)PCM reflashed several times throughout ownershipBoth control arms needed repair(way out of the norm)Total electronic failure at 38,500 miles, and that was the last straw.In sharp contrast, the '01 SClass that I got rid of it for NEVER went to service for nothing more than usual standard MB maintanence and recall repair. This is the model that was the lemon of Germany.And now lets look at my latest offering, the A8 W-12. Not so much as a whisper and this car is far from the assembly line w/ 17000 miles on the clock. And we're still talking German.So Lexus is not immune to deficiency, or ineffeciency for that matter. I know a lot of Lexus' cases are isolated and don't occur often, but read the Lexus threads on this very forum, especially the cars that AREN'T FIVE YEARS OLD YET(ie: current lslife-cycle), and you'll be able to seperate life from fairy tale. We have to remember that these cars are all mechanical, and yes some give-in way before others, but they all have problems. Show me a completely trouble-free car, and I'll dig my own grave.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's funny, I don't even drive a Lexus, I am actually a very proud Jag owner. I have a lot of respect for Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, Jag, Lexus (and a lot of other makes) because they all provide distinct styles, and have all created very attractive automobiles. I find myself defending Lexus because a few people don't want to recognize Lexus as one of the powerhouses when in reality they're. I myself don't really want to drive a Lexus because it's too common, and that's the reason I would not rush out and get a Mercedes or BMW... hence I bought a Jag (really like the Audi too) for its distinct and attractive styling. However, it does not make MBZ, BMW or Lexus any less prestigious in my mind just because I like Jaguar more. I think people have to remember that most big companies, regardless of industry, have had a humble beginning. Before Lamborghini started making ultra exotic cars, they were making tractors! Diamler-Chrysler's Mercedes-Benz passenger car division lost a whopping $2bb in the first half of 2005, if it wasn't for its commercial vehicle division, which makes garbage trucks, buses, commercial vehicles, there probably would have been a reorganization (I do want to add, Mercedes-Benz posted a much more impressive result for the 3rd quarter). Even though Toyota was making small economic cars, doesn't mean they can't make luxury cars, especially when they're made better in a lot of people's minds. I have to say, the new IS and the new lslook very hot, I am not planning to jump boat, but it's tempting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In your first paragraph you're still doing what you've done from the start. Ignoring price. This what if scenario you've come up with isn't based in reality because in reality Mercedes and Lexus aren't the same price, except for in two instances, nor are they held in the same reguard. ""There has to be an agreement on basic principles for rational discourse to take place""This is true. So lets loose the what if scenario because it's not based anywhere near reality. ""You keep wanting to look at Lexus vs MB as on a model by model basis, saying that on a overall (all SUVs + all cars) basis, MB&#146;s unit sales performance is explained by higher model-by-model prices, and that the higher prices aren&#146;t simply compensation for higher prestige/heritage. Well, if that were true, wouldn&#146;t we find that the model matchups where MB is most expensive (relative to Lexus) are the ones where MB sells poorly, and that the matchups where MB is priced similarly to or less than Lexus are the ones where MB sells well? ""You're confusing two issues here. This conversation was never about why a Mercedes costs more, only that they do. Who cares why, for the sake of this discussion. We're talking about sales vs price and vice versa. They ""why"" question is for another topic, and there have been some incorrect theories cast about that in here already anyway. ""In fact the exact opposite is true. It is the matchups where MB is priced similarly to or less than Lexus where MB has its greatest sales weakness. The C-class compared to the LexusES and IS. And the M-class, compared to the RX and GX. In the other lines, where MB is priced higher than Lexus, MB generally sells the same or higher numbers than Lexus?quite the opposite of what your theory implies. (The only exception is the G vs LX, where MB is priced higher and does sell less; but since the LX isn&#146;t a big volume seller itself, the unit [as opposed to percentage] difference isn&#146;t large, so this doesn&#146;t go very far in explaining why Lexus outsells MB).""Again, the IS300 and ES330 are not even close to being the same car, so why are you constantly trying to lump them together? The C-Class outsells the IS300 by about 3 to 1 on a yearly basis. The ES330 outsells the C-Class, again I've stated this a many times. The ML doesn't sell better because, again like I've admitted before, its clearly not up the Lexus SUVs, and it's in its 7th model year, and the Lexi are brand new. You're right here, price has little to do with it due to fact the ML is priced similarly to the GX and RX. That is but one exception. If these are the only two product lines between Mercedes and Lexus in which Mercedes is price competitive, how in the world can that offset the often medium to very large price differences between the GS and EClass , S vs LexusLS, SCvs SL, LX vs G, SCvs certain CLK models, and to mention the CL of which there is no Lexus competitor. You're only looking at the lower half of the Mercedes lineup. ""Here&#146;s my theory. I think that prestige/heritage has a value, and that people will pay extra for it. But people who are concerned about prestige will, if they can afford it, buy towards the high end?if they buy a C the neighbors will know that they&#146;ve got the cheapest MB. So MB is able to extract a bigger &#147;prestige premium&#148; (pricewise) on the E and S than on the C or ML350, for example, and still sell well. And since people at the low end are not as concerned about prestige as those at the mid-high end, other factors become more important?like reliability, roominess, etc. So in my view it isn&#146;t price that explains MB&#146;s sales vs Lexus?it is PRODUCT (or product, reliability, service, etc). For the C, where MB sells fewer units than Lexus despite lower starting prices, maybe those factors are roominess, reliability, service. As for the ML?well, you&#146;ve said yourself that MB has a product problem there, that the vehicle isn&#146;t that desirable."" There are lots of places where this theory doesn't jive with reality. People will pay for prestige yes, but that is only half of the situation.......the other half of that is they'll pay for it WHEN THEY CAN. Prestige means nothing when you want a SL500, but can only afford a SC430. The 30K price difference will, more often than not, make the decision in favor of the SC430. There is no way possible that this kind of price difference doesn't account for some lost sales for Mercedes-Benz.Ferrari and Porsche are held by many to be the best sports car builders on earth. It depends on who you ask as to which is best. Generally Ferrari gets the nod, but it's a fierce debate. There is no debating however when it comes to sales of the two brands. Price is what keeps a Ferrari out of garages of tens of thousands of buyers, many of whom a Porsche is no-sweat to acquire. Yes, other factors play a role in cars sales, again, I've mentioned this many times before. Reliability, comfort etc, etc, the list is endless, but to say that price has nothing to do with a brand like Mercedes' who's lineup is skewed upwards of 50K is cleary incorrect. Look at this:http://www.mbusa.com/brand/index.jspSelect the ""Model Selector"" on the left side. Without even looking to see how many, do you see where most of those cars land on the price chart? The high side. The numbers: There are 14 models below 50K, with the E320 being right on the border at 48K, which you probably can't find at that price on a dealers lot. There are 23(!) models priced above 50K, of these there are 15 priced at 70K or above, right where Lexus tops out at. Of that 15, 8 of them are priced at 90K or above!!!! There is no way this type of pricing doesn't have an effect on overall Mercedes sales. The bottom line is that Mercedes is only price competitive with 2 lines of cars, the rest are prices higher than the competiting Lexi, and thus really shouldn't be able to sell in the numbers they do. Yet you initially tried to state that the ""market"" didn't think much of Mercedes' cars, yet when you look at the numbers the only thing they are missing is the SUV component. Lexus better hope the next ML, and the new GST (R-Class) and the new G-Class don't catch on. The correct thing to say would be that the market doesn't think much of Mercedes' ML (and neither do I), but they obviously think a great deal of their *cars* because despite their higher prices they buy more of them overall and model line vs model line, except in the case of the LexusES vs the C-Class.

"Interesting post...though some there are some inaccuracies. The 5Series andEClass have a nice advantage over the Japanese in this class. The advantage is the general lack of acceptance the C-Class and 7Series has received from America! What? I don't get this one at all Doc. The 7Series has outsold the SClass before so you're way off base there as far as its ""acceptance"". The C-Class is now old and doesn't have the variants to shore up the sales numbers like the 3Series does. Mercedes doesn't count the CLK's sales in with the C-Class like BMW does all the 3Series variants. Very easy to pick on the C-Class this late in its life I think, but that GS you mention is brand new! Mercedes has been so desperate to enhance sales numbers, they've resorted to chopping a C230 up into a hatchback, and knocking the price under $30k to keep sales volume numbers respectable. This only underlines the ineffectiveness of the C-class sedan, especially vs. proven studs like the 3Series and Lexus LexusES. First of all the hatchback has been gone for a while now and the C-Class is usually in the top 5 sellers in that class anyway, so I'm not sure what you're talking about here. Secondly no one from Europe is competing with the push boat LexusES model at what it does best - non driving bliss. I've seen a few of them around now and it and the Maxia are two Japanese cars that consistantly get uglier and uglier with each re-design. Someone has got to tell Lexus designers that a car doesn't have to be completely slab-sided to pass side impact regs. This new LexusES looks like something from pokeman. They can't be serious to say that it has the same L-finesse cues of the IS and new LexusLS. The new Camry actually looks so much better. So EClass sales are inflated due to a weak entry-level car.Does this apply in the reverse when it comes the Lexus GS and ES? Since the GS seems to always fall off dramatically after 18 months or so. People who buy Lexus' aren't into performance anyway so when comparing the LexusES to the GS, the LexusES wins because the GS being RWD is lost on most of them. Oh and yes it most certainly missed the target if the 5Series was the target, missed it by a country mile. If the lsis as good as advertised, the SClass sales will fall from 3k a month to 1500 a month, which is about where they should be. Even Merc would admit 3k sales is a abhorration borne out of a favorable cycle in the market, no? I doubt if sales will half just like that, but no 3K+ a month at 87K to start isn't going to last forever. BMWs are GREAT driver's cars, with some luxury touches tossed in for show. They are not luxury cars.Whoa! If that is the case then sport should be stricken from anything dealing with Lexus' IS and GS with their lack of manual trannies and/or lack of involvement next to those non-luxury car BMWs. Those Lexuses certainly aren't ""sport sedans""! M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's not very gracious for a BMW 7Series owner to call the lssuspension ""rotten tomato""! I found the LexusLS suspension to be competent in a studied way (the whole car is like that). If the new lsif 1/2 as durable as the LexusLS, it will be a great car.merc1, forgive my flashing messages I post and delete at the speed of sound. I've been trying to figure out the new software as I haven't posted in a while. I wanted to say that Dante should have had a special circle of hell for people who can not afford cars they like (me), take years to decide, and want the next thing (always). My own view (and it is contary to convential wisdom I know) is that cars are getting worse and not better. It isn't just Mercedes that is making cars more cheaply- not at all. Volkswagen is no different than Daimler.The new A4 has 7 % more plastic. In fact, you can see some of it in interior pictures. They can not afford to build the current A6 and the next one will be decontented. The A6 doesn't need a facelift! Nothing is perfect for me or anyone else. While you've been insisting on one CD player and the right color combination, Mercedes has been hard at work making a car that looks like a cross between a CLK, a Ford Pinto, and AMC Gremlin !",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Japanese continue to dominate the CR best lists and reliability (if you read the magazine article) seems to be higher than ever while European reliability seems to be worse than ever. One thing of interest is that they thought the SClass ride was actually a tad bit better and more sullen than the LexusLS which is the exact opposite of what I have found in the past. This however is the ultimate battle as both cars have phenomenal ride quality. It's clear that CR considers the S and lsthe best mass production cars on the planet but the S loses out because of poor reliability. The other thing is that the S is only average in customer satisfaction which must be tied to a combination of its poor reliability and high anticipations of the buyer. The lsscored highest marks possible in all categories including depreciation. 7Series was considered to miss the mark as a luxury sedan (my take is because of the difficulty with iDrive and performing ordinary tasks whilee driving) and scored awful in reliabilty and average in satisfaction and depreciation. It was considered very quiet but lacking a great ride. The A8 is too new to be rated (as was the Phaeton) but its clear CR was quite impressed with it. The Jag was considered a classic car but its ride, interior comfort and quietness trailed the S and LexusLS. The Q scored high in reliabilty but misses the mark as a world class car.The Passat tied in a top category as it had average reliabilty. The Passat commercial with the woman test driving a car and passing an unmarked state trooper is one of the best auto ads I've seen recently. The look on the troopers face as he's passed, the auto salesman's face when he realizes what just happened and the excitement on the woman's face as she looks at the auto saleman for approval to pass beforehand all desreve Clio awards.http://money.cnn.com/2004/03/08/pf/autos/CR_best_cars/index.htm?c- - - nn=yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"JBaumgart:Interesting question. Unfortunately, ""none of the above"" seem to apply right now. As a driving ""enthusiast"", I have yet to drive anything from the Japanese marques that impresses me. (Sedan-wise, since I'm not going to include the little Honda S2000 which I do hold in high regard compared to a nearly twice as expensive Boxster S). The Q45 clearly has the LexusLS beat in this area, but it still isn't a 7Series, and nowhere near the AMG or Motorsport level. On the reliability front, I have been extremely pleased with the BMW 5Series (540i 6-speed and M5), but I know far too many friends and associates who have not had good experience recently with EClass , SClass or 7Series. merc1, boo20, pablo, et al.You don't have to convince me of the value of heritage and automotive engineering excellence. Over the last 25 years, I've gone from an original BMW M1 to a 2002 M5 and in between had, amoung others, a 930 Turbo, 300SEL 6.3, and several other ""heritage"" cars. That said, I am not willing to overlook the basic reliability factor, especially when it comes to an everyday driver like the E, S or 7. These are not AMG or M supercars. I hope your consistent cheerleading for Mercedes and against Lexus is not to suggest satisfaction with mediocraty in this area. It clearly needs to be improved, if not for the next quarterly report to Wall Street, for longer term strategic competitiveness. I feel strongly about this. I took over controlling interest in a company several years ago at a time when most in the industry thought that we were ""doing all right"" in the area of customer satisfaction. After firing the senior managers who though we were ""doing all right"" and promoting those who had a desire to do better, we have gone from a market value of under $100 million to over $1 billion. I, for one, sincerely hope that Mercedes in particular does not waste away its heritage with delivering less than acceptable levels of customer satisfaction. The notion that, because Mercedes has lowered it's relative price points, a $50k+EClass is allowed to be less relaible than a $20k Honda Accord, is completely unacceptable to me. And I hope to every Mercedes enthusiast and Daimler Chrysler executive out there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just a quick comment on your post stating the pending releases from MB. Do you suppose these new releases will improve MBs fortunes in the lux space here in the US ? How many CL65s, CLSClasss, or SLKs will MB sell to reverse their sales trend ? Today, all C-class (I presume it includes C, CL, CLK) are behind the single trim Lexus ES330 in sales, so how much uplift will these new redos provide ? Ditto, the SClass sales are way down compared to the LexusLS, will the new S redo in 06/07 reverse the sales chart vs the new redo LS-Hybrid ? And I do not have an answer to your rhetorical question of why Lexus with a 100 less dealerships than MB in the US outsell MBs in total sales ? Maybe the MB oracle (Merc1) knows",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's just like I said before if you can't count all those taxi Mercedes, then you can't count all those so-called ""Lexuses"" running around in other countries as leathered up Toyotas. We disagree on what makes a ""luxury"" car obviously. Leather doesn't define it for me. I'm not trying to say you don't know what you're talking about here, but with the engine thing you really would benefit from doing some research first. Mercedes-Benz has used DOHC 4-Valve-per-cylinder technology in 1980s with the 190E 2.3-16V and again from 1989-1997 with all of their V8, inline 6 and 4-Cylinder engines during those years. The 3-Valve-per-cylinder SOHC engines were/are the ""new"" designs that Mercedes ""implemented"" not the DOHC 4valve setup. If you're going to say that Lexus was first with a V8 setup like this, you'd be wrong there also. Ferrari and other sports car makers did it back in the 50's and Mercedes also launched a DOHC 4v V8 in 1989 with the 500SL. I know you'd like to think otherwise, but Lexus is hardly ""first"" at anything. Mercedes, Ferrari, Maserati, Porsche, Alfa-Romeo, Audi (among others) used this technology before Lexus was even thought about. Toyota does not hold a patent on DOHC 4-valve technology so no other company has to consult Toyota about anything, much less a patent. Audi does a 5valve per cylinder layout as does Ferrari and Toyota wouldn't have to ask them anything if they wanted to design their own 5-valve per cylinder engine. BTW, Toyota had 4-valve per cylinder engines (I4 and V6s) before the 1990 LexusLS also; I'm surprised you didn't know this. Aluminum, DOHC 4valve-per-cylinder, V8 engine construction all in one combination wasn't Toyota ""first"" either, Mercedes was there as was Ferrari and others before the mighty Toyota. syswei, I'm not sure what happened with that, but I too remember something about them at least ""talking"" with Toyota about their hybrid technology. I couldn't get a straight answer from any of the MB reps at Detroit about anything pertaining to drivetrain of the GST, so I'm not sure. Mercedes and the rest of the European makers are so heavily invested in diesels so their hybrid tech and plans are obviously years behind Toyota and Honda, so I'm not sure. All MB has said is that hybrid SClass will be sold here, I'm guessing with the next generation. Toyota must feel pretty good. I mean really you have your competitors (Ford and Nissan) scrambling to buy your OLD technology, I'm impressed. (Rare moment, take note..lol) ljflx, Well as always my friend we are on opposite sides of the world when it comes to styling. You see ""cues"" from a Ford in anSClass, but you can't see where the LexusLS (especially 01-03) looks like a smoothed over Avalon. You say that every company can't be original or do anything from scratch, which is the reasoning any Toyota fan must come up with when looking at their various styling blunders and c____s I guess. European car makers as a whole are far more original than the Japanese, this isn't even debatable when you look at BMW, Jaguar, Audi, MB, Porsche, and others, their designs connect with the past without looking retro at that. Lexus has nothing to draw on here, but the car the consider to be the target. A Jaguar will never, ever look like an Audi. The difference between MB and Lexus is that MBs don't look like their competitors, like Lexus' premier car does. So what if the SClass resembles a Taurus (in your opinion), they'll never be confused like the old S and lscould be by the casual observer, nor are they competitors. That everyone can't be original is just a grand excuse. All the rest of the cars in this class manage to do just that, from scratch and very original. I mean really, think about it, none of the cars we talk about this board look anything alike until you bring the lsinto the fold then you're reminded of 12 year old Benz. Lexus with their lsis the one that can't seem to be original or do anything from scratch, not the rest. Anyway, past thatSClass/Taurus thing I pretty much agree with your summation on the other cars. I really want to drive the A8 or Phaeton to see what all the complaints about the ride are all about. Design wise I find the A8 to be the best car in this class now, just a hood ornament ahead of the S. sv7887, I was ready to ""disagree"" with your post #4601 Item #2, but then I read item #3 so..... I was going to say how in the world could anyone liking Toyota design say anything about anyone else ""borrowing"" anything from any one else when Toyota is the king of such practice???? However since I did read item #3 ignore the previous sentence..... jamesfletcher2, Well I'd say go for the current SClass if you're worried about the next generation styling changes. Plus the reliability of the current S (one of your concerns) is much improved since 2000 and you won't have to worry about the next generation car's newness in that area. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I couldn't agree more with your comments. I have followed the auto industry from ~12 yrs old on (father owned auto dealership) and have graduated to German cars. My current car is an '05 Audi A8L. There is just something about German engineered cars. If you want that rock solid good handling well put together feel - MB/BMW/Audi have it. If you like gizmos - the Japanese have it. As far as reliability. I owned a '00 A6 4.2 prior to the A8 and had zero problems. My ""other"" car is a '02 Denali XL and it, like yours, has been trouble free for 60K+ miles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just curious to know what the group here thinks about some of the new luxury debuts at Detroit. It appears that Audi is going to step to the major leagues with the new a8 6.0 W12 by the end of the year, it will priced around 115K. Yikes! Double yikes because the Phaeton W12 (10hp less btw) is priced at 88K. On paper it makes the Audi version look like a tough sell. What does everyone think of the new grille design of the a8 6.0 model? Car and Driver is reporting that a cheaper short wheelbase ""A8"" will make it here too for 2005. Audi sold over 4K A8s in 2003, a huge increase, but still about 1/5 of the sales leaders in the class. Lexus' RX was clearly the inspiration for the Lincoln Aviator concept, looks pretty good. The Aston-Martin DB9 Volante (convertible speak) is gorgeous, don't even need to be there in person so see that. I so wish I could say the same for new 645Ci convertible. It and the regular 645Ci coupe will have to be examined in person, which isn't a good sign. I don't think I've ever seen a car so messed up by a single styling detail, a trunklid no less!! Two sports cars of interest, the Ferrar 612S and Corvette. The Ferrari looks a little longish, just like the SLR, both have this look due to their engine placement, mid-front. The Vette looks a little derivative of several cars, Ferrari, Viper from the front, but the rest appears to be in order. Any of you luxury car owners eyeing a sports car???? Three new luxury or luxury priced trucks (or concepts) of interest: Jeep Rescue, Lincoln Mark LT and Infiniti QX56. I can't believe Lincoln would attempt this type of truck again, as the Blackwood flopped like the Edsel. The Jeep Rescue is the DCX answer to the Hummer. Not sure how I feel about it yet. The Infiniti might have too much of a Peterbuilt grille to it?? Another crossover, the Mercedes GST. Not sure about this yet either. It too lost something from concept to product, it looks too much like a van. Though I think they're generally pretty clueless, they do have a hell of a photo gallery of the L.A. Autoshow, autospies that is. Of particular interest to the Cali show are the Maserati Quattroporte, Mercedes CLS, Aston-Martin DB9 Coupe, Hummer HT3, and the OMG Porsche Carrera GT, they really do have some great photos of these cars. The Mercedes CLS, which I admit to feeling ill when I first saw it, looks a lot better, as does the Maserati Quattroporte. Thought I've seen the new Bentley Continental GT in person at last year's Detroit show, the new photos still don't help it any, as it still looks like a giant VW. I'll take an Arnage T please. ljflx, I was so busy thinking about the autoshows that I didn't even see your comments on the 7Series. Yes my *used-to-be* second favorite luxury car brand has stumbled design wise with the 7, 6 and now possibly with the 6-Series. Its hard to convey on a mesg board how a lot of BMW fans (including me) feel about BMW's new styling/design direction. What I really don't like is that BMW's top guy simply says that people will just have to get used to the look and tech (meaning idrive). Typical German arrogance, which I can't stand at times. On the other hand it seems that just as many people like the new designs, some of my most devoted BMW-loving friends find the new 5 and 7 to have such great ""presence"". I won't argue with that, question is whether or not thats good or bad. Either way they aren't ""good looking"" cars in the classic sense of the description, but everyone does notice them, so lets sell how the 5Series sells in 2004. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's like reading ""The View"" in transcript! A few points that should be noted: Motorweek LOVED the SClass in their test last week. But they fawn over pretty much every car they test! What was significant to me was it's 5.4 sec 0-60 time, 19MPG road test, and total indifference to their slalom test. They don't show the cars speed through the manuveur, but I've never seen any sedan move through one so flatly! It was like body roll had never been invented yet! VERY IMPRESSIVE! 131 ft braking distance, not what I would call...uh...good. Have seen the 5Series/E-Class/GS/M35 mentioned against one another. Have to bring up a fairly obvious fact that has been overlooked. The 5Series andEClass have a nice advantage over the Japanese in this class. The advantage is the general lack of acceptance the C-Class and 7Series has received from America! Mercedes has been so desperate to enhance sales numbers, they've resorted to chopping a C230 up into a hatchback, and knocking the price under $30k to keep sales volume numbers respectable. This only underlines the ineffectiveness of the C-class sedan, especially vs. proven studs like the 3Series and Lexus LexusES. Since the C-Class is too small to fight the Lexus LexusES, and too stodgy to fight the 3Series, it wallows in mediocrity! So EClass benefits, due to it's proper mid-size platform, which gives it the interior room of a G35/Accord/Camry/TL/ES, cars that Americans buy due to being the right size, and a great value. So EClass sales are inflated due to a weak entry-level car. The 5Series gets the same help from above, as a 4600lb, 16ft long, iDrive-laden, Auto-only, ""Driver's Machine"" doesn't have a very wide demographic. People at that price and size want a GREAT luxury car, and the 7, nor any BMW really, will qualify. BMWs are GREAT driver's cars, with some luxury touches tossed in for show. They are not luxury cars. An ES350 looks like a Rolls Royce compared to ANY 5Series! Same with an lsand a 7Series. Even the 760! Lexus' problem is pretty much everything they build has a nice size audience, a wide demographic of people who want to buy their type of car. The GS hasn't missed the target, it just hasn't hit it, so it wallows, with the C-Class, in mediocrity. I wanted the GS to turn into the 5Series in last redesign, I've said that before. The GS should be a large IS350. The IS is gonna be quite a success story for Lexus (for a change), and the GS should play the bigger, more omnipotent brother, as the lsdoes for the LexusES. Lexus has not put that together......yet. I told them to listen, and now it's too late...... Merc seems to be setting Lexus up for failure, as Lexus has increased sales every year of it's existence. To imply a slow down in Lexus' market share gain would represent failure would be misguided, at best. Now is the time for Lexus to raise prices, somewhat, and look to bolster their image as a prestigious marque. I don't want 400k Lexus sold per year! And I think Lexus can now stand toe-to-toe with any luxury car maker on their products merit. Period! In closing, get a MT in the GS and IS350. Make the GS edgier. Raise prices considerably when redesigning a model. Make the brand more prestigious, not just pristine. If the lsis as good as advertised, the SClass sales will fall from 3k a month to 1500 a month, which is about where they should be. Even Merc would admit 3k sales is a abhorration borne out of a favorable cycle in the market, no? Since a GS430 is still a 5.7 0-60 car, and it is less powerful than the upcoming GS350, much less the GS460, I see a sales spike in the offing. DrFill",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Ksurg: I really like the Audi, but I found it interesting that you are wanting to make the a8 into more of an envigorating sports sedan than it really is....In my own test driving experience the a8 felt like a great luxury sedan. It was a really ""nice ride""-- but it was not particularly fast, sporty, or lithe. Despite Car and Driver, I did not have any complaints about the ride, but I found it almost sedate until pushed it hard in the ""dynamic"" suspension mode. I am not an active member of the Lexus fan club, but I imagine that the new '04 Lexus LexusLS is actually quicker in acceleration, and may even equal or exceed the a8 in handling, with the optional handling package. During my own recent car shopping experience, I also drove the MB SClass (your ""rerun documentary"")and found that it's powertrain and acceleration was pretty spunky compared to the A8L. So in my book, as nice as it is, the Audi is just as much of a sedate luxury cruiser as the Lexus or Mercedes. That said, I still am an admirer of the big Audi, and was almost going to buy one......(None of this should be considered as negative commentary since we are talking about big luxury cars here)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Just an FYI, the LexusES is in the 3Series class. Long before the original Toyota...er.. IS300 came to the States, the LexusES was the only thing Lexus offered. Then the laughable IS300 and now the serious(but not 3Series/A4 worthy) IS250/350 have came along. And moreover, the lsis a cheaper produced car, and this makes it better than any car in it's class? Yes cheaper at the expense of a flaccid suspension, wood so shiny you could see the food between your teeth, the most supportive seats in the class, the dreaded gated shifter(only a smidge better than the J-Gate), oh, and styling? Dare I say, underwhelming to say the very least. These are things that don't make for a very appealing car to a broad spectrum. Hopefully these things that Lexus has corrected, but in Toyota fashion, highly unlikely..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"last friday, drove my entire family up to los angeles to see the '04 car show there. starting from about Del Mar to the car show in LA, we followed:Black Volkswagen Phaeton W12Tectite '03/'04? Mercedes SClass 4MaticBlack sapphire (not sure if it was just dirty black) 745Li.At least it turned a two-hour drive into something exciting! unfortunately, my 15-year son, who is also turning into a car freak, kept on dronning-on about how Audi is trying to enter the once-exclusive MB-BMW groupe with the 6.0 litre a8 V12. He thinks the a8 V8 is the best buy when compared to the MB SClass, Lexus LexusLS, and BMW 745Li. I think he's going to be into luxury cars.The Phaeton--- i really don't understand VW. Do they really think people are going to buy a $70,000 VW? Come on. I can get a MercedesSClass, BMW 7Series, Audi A8L, Lexus LexusLS Ultra-Lux, the list continues. VW is entering dangerous waters here. The Phaeton i saw on I-5 was a W12 model. It was probably the owner/manager of the dealership, as it had a DLR plate. The rear-lights are also something. More like an alien; i think VW could have done a much better job with the rear. I always thought car companies need to work more on the rear (part. Lexus; RX, GS, GX...) because that's were most people see the car when on the road. And overall, not to be ignorant but i truly think the Phaeton is a big-Passat. The front headlights say it all. The driver and his family was heading towards the LA auto-show. The 745Li, we saw about in Orange County. Passed the VW and us really quickly, but caught up to it in LA in the convention centre (outside). Why I am infatuated with the 7? The rear (so ingenious and creative), and the rear door. Another strange thing me and my son both pay extra-close attention about cars are door designs, and in my opinion, BMW best executed it in the 745Li and 760Li lwb models. the rear door is ABSOLUTELY gorgeous. I trully don't understand why soooooo many people find the design controversial. it might take some getting used to (i've got a close friend, and after about a month, I'm already used to iDrive). Granted, it's not exactly the most pleasing-to-the-eye design, like theSClass, but it's something that should not be critized. I'm convinced that the '04 SClass is getting really long in the tooth, and needs to be redesigned soon. Although it's still a gorgeous car (i mean come one, a mercedes is a mercedes), but it could use some plastic surgery or a complete make-over. the 7-speed is a great progress, though, as i have tested it and it is truly amazing.overall, in the car show, i determined that the two most popular cars were probably the BMW 645Ci and the LexusLS Ultra-Lux. The BMW popularity surprised me, as while walking through the 7Series and 530i, i heard a lot of people saying stuff like ""i hate this design."" or ""let's go look at lexus"". but overall, it seemed as though people loved the 645ci, and so did i. i have become addicted to it (even more so than the 745Li). the interior is quite roomy, and quality was impressive.The LexusLS, which greatly needed that refresh, is still a little to ""boxy"" and shared numerous characteristics with both the previous-generation SClass (call it the cathedral-on-wheels) and the previous-generation CL-Class. The rear-seat affair was truly amazing, and I've got to give credit to the guys at Lexus; they did a damn good job at giving both the drivers and passengers lots of comfort. I think lexus is trying to become more like a poor-man's Bently; luxurious, with a slight twist of power. Just look at the LexusLS or SC430. They even bill their Sport Utility Vehicles ""Luxury Utility Vehicles"". Whereas Infiniti seems as though it's heading towards german BMW-land.I don't know. I got mixed feelings from this car show.iDriveby the way, my son just told me an interesting comparison; he calls Apple Computers the equivalent of Infiniti; great (almost) looking cars (like the G35 coupe/FX45), but whether or not their insides are that good remain to be seen). intersting thought.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lease differences in some cases eliminate the MSRP differences altogether. Phaetons and A8's at higher MSRPs can be had at lower lease prices than custom lux LS30's and much lower than ultra lux ls's which are cloesr to their MSRP's. No one seems to care. I paid $40 more a month for my $62K LexusLS in 2001 then I would have paid for a $73K A8. I knew I was getting the better car and three years later that lsis worth more than the A8. People who were leasing ultras in 2001 were paying far more than comparably priced A8's and BMW's and in some cases more than amSClass. Ultras at $71K in 2001 were going above $1300 a month whereas the $75K SClass I priced was around $1250 per. That was because Lexus was uncertain how well its first $70k+ car would retain value. The joke was that it turned out to be the most in demand lsback then.I said before a $77K 7Series was around the same lease price as the $65K LexusLS two months ago when I leased but I had no interest. Finally the SClass was about $180 more than my 2001 LexusLS and the price difference was $13K MSRP. The SClass price difference was about $350 more in 2001 then now but that MSRP price difference was $22K. To anyone above $250-300K in income those lease price differences would likely not be a big deal unless they were fully loaded with high mortgages on a first home or were carrying pretty high mortgages on a first and second one. My personal belief and experience are that the people reaching for prestige are not the SClass buyers but EClass buyers. That's why Lexus will more easily convert an SClass buyer to an lsthan anEClass buyer to a GS or LexusLS. The other feeling I've picked up is a simple ""in denial"" thought process that anyone can match or exceed the revered Germans. Many of the people I've met in the past that put Lexus down had never even sat in a Lexus car.

I do think that data is interesting because the Asians collectively are taking share at a fairly healthy clip from the German brands in the European marketplace. The Lexus brand isn't broken out from Toyota but I do know that Lexus is fairly weak in Europe.To continue the discussion in 4958, 4959, 4965, what I'll say is that for the US market, if you look at data from the company press releases or autosite.com, looking at Lexus and MB specifically, the LexusES outsells the C, the E outsells the GS, the lsoutsells the S, and the RX outsells the M. My point of view is that for the US market, those respective models that are selling better than their counterparts are doing a better job of meeting (or at least promising to meet) their respective target audiences' needs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Len,I think that you are probably the most qualified to answer this question. As you know I will be getting the new LS600hL when it becomes available next spring. I currently own (I paid cash) a 2004 LexusLS. I already have a couple of willing buyers for the LexusLS. My question is this: Would it be to my advantage to purchase outright or to lease the new LS600hL? At first, I was thinking that I was going to purchase. However, I have been having second thoughts lately. The technology is changing so fast with hybrids, etc. that it might be better if I lease it. In fact, we did lease the RX400h that my wife drives. It was a special one payment ($25,000) lease . We have a choice after 3 years (May 1 of 2008) whether to pay a balance of about $32,500 and own the RX400h or to give it up and get something new. I am very happy that we took this option since it gives us the freedom to do what we want after 3 years. I am almost positive that we will give it up and lease something new at that time. Who knows what the next generation RX hybrid will be like? It may be out of this world. So, what do you think I should do when the LS600hL is available? I know this is still pretty far into the future, but it does not hurt to ask.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lenscap, Those 2000 03'EClasses that were bought back because the new DVD-based Nav system couldn't be retro-fitted, not because those 2000 E320s and E500s were lemons. I think they handled the problem in the best way possible. ljflx, Why do you insist on comparing the ls's so-called ""Euro"" option to the base Mercedes SClass when Mercedes has a ""Sport"" package of their own designed to improve handling/braking etc? That isn't a fair comparision. If you compare the Sport versions of each car you'll find that the S is the more capable road car, at least until 04's models are tested. I still think you're promoting a double standard when it comes to magazines, because one minute their right on the money and they next minute they don't have a clue. BTW, there is no ""hard"" road feel in a BMW 7Series orSClass, they ride smoothly too, difference is you can still tell what the car is doing, unlike the LexusLS. You're making it sound like the 7Series rides hard or something and it doesn't. And yes I have driven both the 7Series and 760Li, the V12 extensively. Switching gears here a little. I don't know if you've ever been to one of BMW's Susan G Komen charity events? Its the best way to experience their cars without paying for their other driving programs. I spent the entire afternoon a few weeks ago driving the Z4, 3Series , 745i, 760Li and 540i. Man what fun it was! There weren't many people on this particular day (a Friday) so I got to spend some real quality time with the 7Series, especially the 760Li. What a car, turbine smooth and deceptively fast. The writers are right about I-drive. Get this, even the BMW reps warned not to try and use it while driving. Well being who I am I did so anyway. I honestly couldn't do anything with it more than adjusting the radio and air conditioning, and I'm not afraid of ""tech"" like a lot of people are, but I feel the need to shake a few BMW engineers for this overcomplication. The best thing I found out, is to simply use the voice command. We've talked about the styling before and its still ugly to me. That trunk lid is just unacceptable. I got to race a guy in the 760Li when I first took the 7Series out, the V12 needs lots of space to show it's superiority as we found out it doesn't really start pulling hard until you're really ""speeding"". Still this is a direct contrast to the previous 7Series /7SeriesL relationship because when I drove those two cars the 7SeriesL didn't seem any faster than the 7Series , just a lot heavier. sv7887, Why all the what if scenarios? Mercedes isn't going to sell at 6-cylinder SClass here again, so whats the point? At least not until they new direct injection (read: more power) V6's come out, even if they do it then I'll be shocked. Boo20 spoke about solidity not reliability, two very different things. You really hold CR and JDP as the end-all bible reguarding everything concerning the automobile, even things they can't measure...amazing as no one said anything about reliability. BTW, where can I get a LexusLS for just over 40K? Since we're using Automobile Magazine...did you see what they said about the 04' LS? ""Lexus continues to portray this car as a competitor to the SClass and 7Series, but the LexusLS actually follows the same archly conservative formula that once made Cadillac and Lincoln the big dogs in this class. The LexusLS is still the best car in the world to own. However the luxury here is simply that you never think about driving the LexusLS. This is the ultimate in consumer goods, not the ultimate in luxury goods.""Wow, exactly what European car fans have been saying all along. The lsis the worlds greatest appliance, reliable, but boring and totally uninspiring, with nothing for a ""driver"" to appreciate. I guess they're wrong about this right?M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Let me try to clear something up. I never suggested that Lexus is a &#147;better&#148; &#147;vehicle&#148; for Merc1 or anyone else simply because Lexus sells more &#147;vehicles&#148;; nor is MB a &#147;better&#148; &#147;car&#148; for myself or anyone else simply because MB sells more &#147;cars&#148;. As I tried to express in my post to Pablo, an individual can have his own ideas as to what vehicle is best for him, based on his own needs, desires, and preferences?what I&#146;ll call an &#147;individual&#146;s best vehicle&#148;. What I find valuable in looking at aggregate sales data is that, as I posted before, I think such data &#147;shows which company is doing a better job of meeting real market needs.&#148; Market or aggregate needs, not individual needs.gscoupe and ljflx,Your suggestion that we consider the RX to be a car is interesting, but we&#146;re just not going to find any data on how many RX owners considered a wagon vs how many considered a competing SUV. If we knew that we could apportion a certain fraction of RX sales to the SUV side and the rest to the car side?who knows, maybe Lexus would then beat MB in both cars and SUVs. (Just a possibility, as I said we have no data.)Merc1,You wrote, &#147;People will pay for prestige yes?they'll pay for it WHEN THEY CAN. Prestige means nothing when you want a SL500, but can only afford a SC430.&#148; My response is that one of MB&#146;s strengths is its broad product line. You know as well as I do that buyers who can&#146;t afford the SClass can and sometimes do buy the CLK. Some of your beloved carmags even put the SCand CLK in the same comparo. And as for the lsand S, you well know, and I have even seen some examples on Edmunds boards, that sometimes lsprospective buyers cross-shop vs the E, not the S. So whether it is the SC430 vs CLK500 cabrio, or LexusLS vs E500, there are choices out there for the prestige-loving MB fan that doesn&#146;t have the cash for more car. He isn&#146;t in a situation where he &#147;can only afford a SC430&#148; or LexusLS. Your analogy of Porsche/Ferrari vs Lexus/MB is a flawed one because in the Lexus/MB case, MB&#146;s price range fully encompasses Lexus&#146;?MB&#146;s low end starts 13% LOWER than Lexus&#146;. Whereas in the Porsche/Ferrari case, Ferrari&#146;s low end price starts 238% HIGHER than Porsche&#146;s.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Let's see if I got this right. Because the A8 doesn't have the mind-boggling sales of the lsor S, that makes it a loser? I'm not quite following that assumptions as the A8 has the beans to play in this arena, not something the current bloated lscan say, what with it's Buick Park Ave-esque styling.I'm the proud owner of '06 A8 W-12 and am very impressed with the car. Top quality and craftsmanship SHOULD be the focus of the perspective buyer, not because it sales so well I guess I'll buy one too.I've owned all of the big-league rides, most recently a S65 AMG and BMW 760il. Both were great cars, respectively. And yes, they do outsell the Audi, by quite a wide margin. But it's the build quality and customer service of the Audi that did it for me. Maybe it's the small dealer network that affords such great customer service. But it does work. Not something that I can say for my recent experiences with Mercedes and Lexus.Lexus,M-B,BMW,Jag, even Caddy outsell Audi. Yet somehow this makes the car look bad. Not necessarily true. The A8 is more that deserving of a place in the big-leagues, sales or not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The market has spoken, the RX proved to be the most successful luxury vehicle ever; whereas the ML single-handed destroyed any illusion that MB means luxury. X5 can not keep up with FX. The current ML and G can not begin to compare to RX, GX or LX in terms of luxury; what future brings is irrelevent to this discussion, so some posts claimed earlier. Even if we do allow future into this potporii, the future ML is nothing more than MB attempting to copy Lexus' success offering a car-based SUV with some degree of real luxury.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ladies and Gentlemen. I own 2 of MB's finest. The 2002 SClass with AMG Sport Package, and the 2003 SL500 hardtop convertible. I also own the 2002 Lexus GS300 which I think is the best car that Lexus makes overall. All of the things you guys are arguing about are subjective. I personally didn't buy the LexusLS because I think it looks too bland. IMO Lexus did the same thing that Infinity did with the Q45 before it's recent renovation. They were afraid of alienating their client base and went for safe and bland instead of being creative and going for beauty and excitement. The numbers tell the story well. The Q45 lost a huge market segment, ( and Lexus isn't meeting their sales expectations with the LexusLS either. The other cars, the RX, GS, LexusES and SC's are selling gangbusters) . Mercedes on the other hand has been bold and a leader in not only technological innovation, ie Brake by wire technology, keyless go, radar controlled cruise control , 16 seconds to go from a hard top touring sedan to a convertible, etc. MB has led the way in styling. TheSClass,EClass, SClass class and others are the most stunning looking cars on the road. Are they perfect ? None of them are. I for one don't like that MB still uses cd rom technology for the nav system. At the same time I hate the looks of the LexusLS. It's bland and doesn't generate excitement when I look at it. The wheels on the base model LexusLS look like something you'd see on a Ford Escort. The GS on the other hand looks like it performs. Exciting, quick,etc. I have the new GS 300 with the Sport Package and the shifting paddles built into the wheels. I'm still young. I'm 39 and people still card me when I go out because I look like a teen. Everywhere I go when I use the valet my cars are displayed at the front door, while the ls's are relegated to the other end of the lot...

The IS is a great start, and hopefully the new lswill be enough to compete with Europe's finest.I don't have to ""gussy"" up Audi as the company does that on it's on. I don't know what radar you've looked at but Audi's mainstream cars sell quite well, better than Lexus vehicles of the same price range(A4/IS v. A6/GS). And all this talk about Audi's demand is nothing short of blasphemy. The A8 is shorted by export, not by demand in the US. Some have said they see A8's on the lots frequent, I've never seen an A8 sit very long. And the cars I named aren't limited by choice as the QP sells are not nearly what Maser wanted them to be. The FS has a 2 year wait due to material shortage, and the XJ sales have plummeted worldwide. By choice??

"Lets try not to double post, mk? Are you saying that the C230 coupe isnt down market? Or how about the 325i, A4 1.8T, X-type 2.5? The LexusES prices above the Mercedes, and about the same as the Audi, BMW, and Jaguar. If you want to complain about where the LexusES comes from (and less than 25% of parts are shared) then Jaguar is just as guilty, if not more so. As for the RX, I dont see what the problem is there, either. Is the X3 going to ruin BMW as a top tier player? Lexus is a 15 year old company, and when you compare them to companies that have been around more than 100 years, I think they are doing pretty well for themselves. They've certainly shown Honda and Nissan how its done, and even die hard German buyers have to admit that Lexus has had a significant impact on how the Germans do business and design their cars. This SClass will not have another 14 year cycle as the last one did. When Lexus fully establishes itself as a world market brand, their position should only go up.Merc, I think 500hp is too much for a Lexus too. If there Germans werent in this all out war with each other to have their quad turbo V-12 be more powerful than the other guys quad turbo V-12, then Lexus wouldnt be building this car.

They are very reliable, but that does not necessarily mean durable. There is a HUGE difference between the two. The reliability edge is also diminishing. Jaguar, Cadillac, MB, BMW, and even Buick have all either closed the gap, or are in the process of doing so with new releases. For value driven buyers, Lexus is a good buy, although Acura, Cadillac, Volvo, and Infiniti are better in many areas.As for premium automobiles, they are always a step behind in styling, technology, performance, and safety.

Lexus never had costs to cut as they were very low right from the get go. This is business 101 we are talking about. You are an entrant into an established field with much lower costs than your competition. Why on earth would you price your product with theirs. That's the quickest way to failure for a start-up business that there is. Let's have some common business sense here. If you look at things from a long-term perspective as a company like Toyota does you'll see that MB prices have dropped since 1990 while Lexus prices are up in a range of 30-100% and on average 50%. Initial lscost was 35-42K with most cars at 40K. Current prices are 58-73K with most prices at 63K and with the 2007 model we'll see thos prices jump $7-10K+. Meanwhile the S just came down another $2K. That is the way you go about a LT business plan on pricing and the execution here is letter perfect. Peace.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Lexus simply only sells well in North America. In Europe Lexus has masterd only 20,000 units for the ENTIRE EU, while Audi alone has managed over 554,000 units, BMW, 579,000 units, and MB around 680,000 units. World-Wide Lexus cannot come close to the three main ""World"" Luxury Carmakers. Audi alone outsells Lexus 4 to 1 worldwide and it isn't sitting still in the US any longer. It is producing some of the BEST cars easily in the world along with its competition. I am not bashing Lexus as at all, but North America skews the perspective in terms of Lexus' success. Having seriously driven the top luxury vehicles in many road tests including the Phaeton, the LexusLS has a long way to go to have the same driving dynamics as the Germans. Audi's interiors and fit and finish easily trump Lexus as proven in many reviews around the world. Lexus cannot rely strictly on it JD Power ratings if it is to be a success in the world. The Germans have recommitted themselves to the total package as recently evidenced by Consumer Reports recommending the a8 as best in its class with the least of amount of problems per 100. This rise will continue, so Lexus must create vehicles that can match Audi, MB, and BMW's driving dynamics, design, motorsport reputation (do your homework to see Audi's legendary race history), technology, and pure passion as displayed by Audi, MB, and BMW owners towards their vehicles. When Lexus does this, then it will join the ranks of a ""World"" luxury carmaker.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Lexusguy, I agree with you. My point is the quality of the switches themselves. The next time you see an original LexusLS (90-94) get inside and feel how the turn signal and wiper stalks feel. Then look at the window switches and especially the dimmer for the dash.You are correct to say Lexus has put higher quality materials in their cars. There is a ton more wood in my LexusLS than any of my ls's. I was talking more along the line of switches and console design. Look at the dash and control panel of a LexusLS (90-92) and compare it to the LexusLS. Now imagine a 1990 LexusLS with all that wood added to it. Now that I think of it, the LS460 is the best representation of this. My comment about Lexus relability comes from Lexus mechanics from various dealers. They repeatedly refer to the original cars as those from the golden age. When I talk about long term quality I'm taking about 10 yrs not the 3 JDP uses. Lexus doesn't have to care what I think, as I'm in the minority of owners who keeps their cars this long. I've seen other Lexus owners on this same board worry about how the LexusLS will hold up long term. There is no doubt in my mind that it will not perform as well as the LexusLS of mine did. Simply put ALL of these HELM's are putting pointless technology in these cars.The MB SClass was a classic example of this. They took a step backward in design. Technologically the car is a marvel, but why invest so much in electronics that have been the cause of your reliability problems? The SClass I just bought is complex as it is. I still don't know what half of those buttons do. The interior of the new S was clunky compared to the old one. The Interior really did not do it for me..It reminds me of the differences from the 2000 lsto 2001 LexusLS. Lexus had a nice sleek looking car, yet made it look too bulky inside and out. With the LS460 they've moved back to a good design, but something is still missing. The new LS460's interior is wonderful, but why isn't AWD a standard no cost option like on Mercedes? The design is not bad, but nothing special either. (I think the same of most cars these days). They're making a big jump by introducing a lot of technology, but they lost something in the exterior design from concept to actual product. My main reason for the switch is the poor customer service I got from both Corporate and the Dealers. They have this attitude that they didn't have back in 1992. I'm sure Mercedes will be no different, but Lexus needs to realize this is a problem. It is foolish to think Mercedes will NOT clean up it's act. What is going to happen when Mercedes gets it's quality issues sorted? With designs like the CL SClass and SClass 500 they will pose a serious threat to Lexus. In the USA Lexus is dominant for obvious reasons, but that isn't the case worldwide. I've owned 4 Lexus cars, all ls/430's. Lexus lost me as a customer for a variety of reasons, some of which I've highlighted. Many of the posters here are sticking to Lexus purely for Reliabilty and Customer Service.

In creating the Hybrid, Toyota and Honda have presented a viable technology. Okay, it's not a replacement for oil, but it at least makes for a more efficient technology. ???I'll be very impressed if the RX400h lives up to the hype. The allure of the hybrid technology is almost enough for me to trade my 02 lsin 2006/7 when the new Hybrid lsis expected. This is what I call revolutionary technology. SV",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"LG, doc, topspin and others, why has the A8 and S become the root of topic here? Top says the A8 is so horridly put together yet it is the most wanted by the editors on this very forum for '06(no Lexus to be found)!! The S is so passe, yet it is easily more recognized than a bloated Toyota, and it has more prestige to boot. Build Quality? It is known all over the world that it is very hard to top Audi's rock-solid construction, precision, execution of details, use of materials. And Mercedes has now been quoted several times as one of the ""top builders"" by many respected journalist(Csba Csere- the C&D Ed-In-Chief that Doc loves to talk about). While true the W220 did have it share of woes, the W221 is entirely different beast, and please quote me on that one. The lsis staid in comparison to both of them, despsite the interior freshening. Sit in a SClass and A8, then try a LexusLS, shiny maple and all.Performance. The LexIthinkIcans can rant all you want about a 3 year old test that the ls""won"", but if the SClass was there, it would've been an entirely different playing field. True, both the A8 and S is a step behind the 7 in the adhesion department, but the Lexus is, well, Park Avenue-esque in the turns(don't want to sound ""bad""-but it is). So strange that all of sudden MB,BMW, and Audi are getting hammered on performance models of the big cars, but why did Lexus say that the ""600"" will have the performance to hang with the ""big guys""?? Now Lexus has joined the autobahn stormers?? Very interesting indeed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lexus does cheap sell the lsbecause they know that their product doesn't have the cachet that high end buyers are seeking.At the lower levels, the LexusES Lexus is priced right with the BMW 3Series and M-BCClass. Lexus has a much lower build cost, since the LexusES is essentially a Camry, but prices the car with the Germans.Why? Because at that market position, Lexus has as much cachet and image as the Germans.When you get into real money, Lexus doesn't.Image and cachet are ethereal things. A Corvette Z06 will run circles around most Ferrari's and Porsches. Yet there are plenty of people who will spend twice the price of the vette or more for the image. Lexus suffers from the perception that it is noting more than a fancy Toyota.Second, it has been my observation in the car business that people tend to buy as much car as they can afford.If you are shopping $70,000 cars, you don't drop down and buy a $50,000 car.I would say that most lsbuyers never seriously contemplated a 7Series or anSClass, and vice versa.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lexus has made tremendous strides in both product development and image development over the years, but I wonder if the image development is starting to overshoot the overall product development.There are two scenarios that can occur when the image and actual product are not in sync. First, if the product is better than the image, than the consumer is ultimately pleased BEYOND expectations. Not a bad thing at all, except that the marketers may be leaving money on the table. Second, if the image (hype in some cases) is better than the actual product, then this as a prescription for disappointment, as the product can not fulfill the expectations of the developed image.In the case of Lexus, the point of commonplace knowledge has practically been reached regarding reliability and that's a good thing, but when the image development is so good that many consumers just expect Lexus to be the very ""best"" vehicles, there is room for concern. Are the LexusES, GS, SCand current SUV's really the ""best""? This discrepency between the image and the truth is very real, IMO and I think that it is fortunate for Lexus that the newest line of cars is an overall big improvement, but on the other hand it still falls short. There are still design weaknesses, performance weaknesses, and SUV deficiencies at this point in time, IMO. I am not trying to slam Lexus, as it is known that I respect them as a huge success that is well-deserved, but it is only right to keep a balanced overall perspective.I believe that the Lexus image may have very well surpassed the OVERALL product line at this moment in time, contrary to the cheerleaders that think that Lexus is poised to make a dramatic leap. IMO, Lexus desperately needs a newer and fresher line of SUV's and crossover vehicle. IMO, Lexus should make the LexusES a true Lexus! IMO, Lexus needs to continue to improve overall vehicle performance across the board. IMO, Lexus should categorically make the GS a performance LEADER . . . top in its class. IMO, the ls(swb) should have a genuine sports variant to truly compete with AMG and the M. IMO, Lexus needs to totally replace the SCwith a REAL sports coupe, not a reconfigured LexusLS. These are more than enough issues to address if Lexus wants to live up to its image. The cheerleading is great, but ultimately it comes down to reality . . . and if the reality is not up to the image, then things can start to go south . . . even for Lexus.Do I think that things will go south for Lexus? . . . no I do not, but I do think that all this just goes to show that there is plenty of homework to be done at Lexus, no matter what the Doc and Steve and other die-hard Lexicans think.The new lsis going to be a smashing success, and the LS600hL will be a tremendous testimony to the capabilities of Lexus. The new IS is a great success as well, so to be balanced, the Lexus train will steadfastly move forward with tremendous power. I just want to make it known that, at least in my opinion, Lexus has a lot of work to do, and that there are still MANY very good legitimate reasons why so many people would rather buy other marques instead of a Lexus.Lexus needs to make sure it lives up to the image it has created and address their many shortcomings.TagMan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Like I said before Lexus folk are always short on facts. You being the perfect example of this. Edmund's first drive was of the E500, not the E320. Fact is the E320 starts around 47K, and one would have to check every option on the list to push the price to 61K. A E320 DOES NOT COSTS 61K. PERIOD. The E320 starts at $47,615, and the E500 starts at $55,515. You're telling me to go by facts yet you take a statements like ""an climb to dizzying heights if you tack on some of the above-mentioned options"" as fact, totally ridiculous. Yes I contend the E, especially the new E500 is sportier than the LexusLS. The LexusLS by design is an isolation chamber. No matter how politely you word it, whether you're questioning someone's ""wisdom"" or whatever you're still basically saying they're stupid for purchasing anything but an LexusLS. "" Even if I am off by a k or 2, the point (i.e., the secondary point I was trying to make) is the same. The E is vastly overpriced when compared to it competition. I can't think of an explanation other than DC can get away with it because people fawn over the 3 pointed star.""I say you're off by more than 2K, try about 10K+ for the E320 (the car you claimed costs 61K). As far as people ""fawning"" over the three pointed star well don't feel slighted because the chromed ""L"" doesn't get as much respect. Lexus fans are always reaching for something. Taking something that Edmunds says and then getting it wrong is the perfect example of this. You don't think anyone has ever purchased a Lexus for the look-at-me factor? Come on now.

"Like it or not, the A8 is here to stay. Low exports to the States or high, the car has a great following of people that own them. BTW: The A8 and S are often neck and neck in Europe and elsewhere. Often times, the A8 will outsell the S, especially before the '07. So again, these baseless facts that have come about by yourself and others are just that: baseless and tired. The A8 is limited by export only on the restraint that the company has because they build them as fast as they sell. If Lexus sold as many LS' in the native Asia as they do here, then it'll be the same way. But then again, the A8 does outsell it there too, by quite a margin. And more on the ""value"" quotent of the LexusLS. Yes, it does win here. But a fully opted LS(average transaction of 70k) is where the big guns usually start, the A8, XJ, and 7. And with the average transaction of a SClass nowadays at 92-95k, it seems that the lsis the discount of the class. And with prices moving up only slightly, it's likely to stay that way. So in that saying, you really do get what you pay for...The LJ v. Audi of America case has been thrown out, so why retry it??",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Like Merc1, I have been gone for quite a while (seemed I was not missed, which is cool....). Business trips have taken so much of my time. And to top it off, company now involved in a fresh M&A (our Bus-Dev guys are keeping us very busy and on our toes). Now will have even less time for indulging on Edmunds. Have seen so many MBs here in San Diego especially the high-end ones. Lots of SLs, CLs and CLKs. Not to mention countless 3s and 5s everywhere. Lexus is holding its own pretty well here too. But luxury cars/luxury SUVs/high-end sport cars are huge around here. Way too many nouveau rich guys and gals living here. We are a city defined by what we drive rather than what drives us ! At least thats being my experience in my 6 years living in this city.With so much talk of the 2006 S, has anyone sighted a 2006/2007 lspreview car anywhere ? Does anyone know when Lexus will start a roadshow for the new ls? In all, there's not being much change here, which is a good thing. From time to time, as work lessens over the next few months, I'll stop in here and put in a word or two. Hope you all keep things civil as usual... wink wink... And best to Merc1 wherever he may be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Like Sam, I suppose I'm an exception to the rule that LS's are built ""bulletproof"". Well in the 32,000 miles of ownership of my '98 ls(brand spankin' new with 3 miles on the odo_), The electroluminescent gauge cluster, the entire steering rack, and the two front hub assemblies had to be replaced, albeit all under warranty. Which led me to the question, if this happening now, wonder what this car has plan down the line?All I'm saying is that, yes the Lexus is known for it's Toyota-esque legendary reliability, but it is not without fault, in fact far from it. By comparison, my '01 SClass was a model of refinement and reliability, without any quality problems whatsoever. And once again, this was supposed to be one of the worst years of the W220's platform.P.S.- altho the Lexus interiors are quite nice, maybe a tad nicer than the M-B's interior(materials wise), it is still far from best in class. That crown has lived in Audi's stable fo quite a while. And this was the major selling point on my recent purchase of a '06 A8 W-12.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Likely much ado about nothing if the prices LJ gave hold up. There is no reason to think they won't as they seem logical to me for a car as upgraded as the LS460 is compared to the LexusLS. I think LS460L prices will likely match the a8 and come very close to the 750Li. M,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Livinbmw, ?Again you state baseless opinions..Where are the facts to back this up? I think the RX has been widely praised across the board in the auto mags. It's not like the typical SUV owner is looking for a high performance truck! The RX is giving the public what it wants, as evidenced by the sales. Even if they were, get a Porsche for pete's sake. I'm sure a Cayenne will outperform anything else. ??As for the residuals argument. The depreciation stats are determined by what the market is willing to pay, not what the Lease contract states. Have a look at the used car listings for a true representative sample. I had this argument with a Jaguar dealer last week, and in the end they had to concede I was right. ?As far as NADA, the Lexus dealer seems to use something new everytime I go there. The Herb Chambers dealer nearby actually uses Kelley Blue Book. Oddly enough they actually invite you to look up the car's value on their terminal. Maybe it varies by dealer. Go figure.I'm sure the host is going to intervene at this point and tell us all to cool it. So on anoter note...Is it me, or am I seeing a higher percentage of female drivers in the high end cars? I've seen scores of women driving XJ's, ls's and even SClass cars. What do you all think?SV",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"LJ, yet another one of your ridiculous and flat-out insane thoughts. And yes, the Europeans think the same way about the Lexus. It isn't even considered an HELM there, more like a poseur. The A8 does sell in low numbers, but so does the QP, XJ, Flying Spur, and all versions of the ""hot"" M/S/AMG super-sedans, but this makes them unworthy and not notable?? Cars that are far superior here and abroad than the lsis?The fact that you say Audi as a brand doesn't measure up, yet even in the compact (A4) class, it outsells the IS 3-1, and it has 2 hot versions, something the IS is working on, especially the ISClass, in which I hope the company does build to compete with the RS 4 and M3, it's main competitors. The A6, which is beyond any GS, is the best selling premium car, worldwide. Yes this includes the ""I live in America and could give a hoot(I know other words than the derogatory- that makes ""you"" look ""bad"") about Europe. And the A8, while relatively low in sales as usual in the U.S., is the best large sedan I've ever had as far as balance of ride/handling goes behind my 760iL last year. And it has stock 20"" wheels on it, which given the mammoth size of them, the ride is strikingly amazing because of Audi's trick air suspension, one of the best out there. It's good enough for Porsche, isn't it, the company everyone loves to love?Now to LS600H. You can argue to the crack of dawn about all of it's techs and features. But to carry the ""600"" moniker, they could've at least given the car more oomph to compete with the real 600. Admittedly, the 600h's numbers haven't been finalized, but I can't see Lexus going to much higher than 430, which is fine, but not a class standout as you'd have it. And with Lexus tooting about all of it's inherit performance, I mentioned that about it's relatively low power output in light of the super sedans like the SClass putting down over 500 horses with very little compromise. And yes, I will admit that HSD is a very great introduction into the market place, but the jury is still out on it's long-term reliability(dare I say this and Lexus in the same sentence) with all of the Prius problems that have plagued the technology since the '04 Prius, the same can be said about Honda's IMA.So all of the senical and snobbish comments you dish out has been dismissed as blatant ignorance and rudeness, no swearing needed....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ljflx - I suppose we have different standards, with mine being more on the performance side.The problem with the lsbrakes I find, is its lack of response when first applied, lack of brake feel- your brakes are either on or off, if you know what I mean. I would not enjoy pushing the lsto its limit unlike the GS,SClass, 7Series or A8.As a true 'back seat' luxury car, I find the SClass (stretched version) and 7Series (L wheel base) much roomier, the lsis simply too tight.I like the quietness in the LexusLS, although as mentioned, the soft suspension causing the excessive roll was not pleasant at all in the back...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ljflx- Sure some people cross shop MB and Lexus, but they are really Apples and Oranges. Lexus products are much softer and geared towards luxury and comfort first. Lexus offers superior value so people motivated by price or who can't afford the added expense usually opt for Lexus. Lincoln, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac have suffered the most from the emergence of Lexus, not Mercedes and BMW. BMW and MB both are enjoying record sales years, and have done so for several consecutive years. Moreover every ""comparable"" MB model is at least $10K-$15K more than Lexus, yet MB still manages to sell more than its fair share. Lexus may look to MB and BMW for direction as they always have, but they have stolen sales from Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, and Lincoln mostly. Lexus is probably one of the most important reasons Oldsmobile lost so much market share and shut down.Competition is good for any industry, however you cannot foolishly assert that every LexusLS driving down the road is one lessSClass. That is ridiculous. The lsstarts at $55K, you can't even think about an SClass for less than $75K. A $20K spread is reason enough for many buyers to look at Lexus. But how would you explain record sales and profits for MB if Lexus is supposedly stealing so much share? The SClass is in direct competition with the A8 and 7Series mostly. Sure the Q45, Deville, RL, etc. can all claim to be in the competitive set, but they are really LexusLS competitors. Lexus by and large is an old person's car. It is just a modern interpretation of what Buick, Lincoln, and Cadillac used to do so well before Lexus emerged. Create plush, comfortable, and luxurious cars. However, the lack of innovation inherent since the company's founding causes it to be lacking in ""Soul"" and leadership. Again, I ask anyone to name one Lexus automobile innovation? When MB can point to ABS, Crumple zones, Stability control, distronic cruise control, sensotronic brakes, and a host of other innovations, that fully illustrates it is playing in a different league altogether than Lexus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"LjflxYou have made the most fatal blunder, one of epic proportions and once the ball is set rolling it is unstoppable. Everyone has jumped on this band-wagon of super-luxury resulting in great chaos in this otherwise sober thread. In the spirit of Love and compassion however, I must bring you back to the right way of looking at things as they are. Please allow me to proceed:You have seriously mis-represented what I meant. I never confused the HELM market with SUPER-HELM market. In fact all along I have been clearing your doubts about the true nature of HELM market and what drives it. Please pay attention: Although HELM is mass-market compared to SUPER-HELM it is still a niche pocket compared to true mass-market cars (READ Entry-luxury like 3Series, IS, C-class) or MID-LUXURY such asEClass, 5Series, A6, GS, Infiniti-M. Mass Market: 17 millionTotal market for Entry Lux: 1.2 millionTotal market for Mid-Lux: 400,000Total market for HELM: 100,000 (S,7,A8,LS,Maserati etc)SUPER-HELM: 10,000 (Maybach, RR, 612-Scaglietti etc)Just because you see many HELMs on road does not make them mass-market like camry. ""MASS-MARKET IS A RELATIVE WORD""Ljflx, my fiend, it is you who have confused all these and lumped them together.HELMS are generally the FLAGSHIP vehicles and being the FLAGSHIPS, they carry a serious and proud burden on their heads and shoulders. They are not to be trifled with, nor they should be sold for long periods of time at cut-rate prices, lest their true potential is left unexplored. lsis the flagship of Lexus and symbolizes the best of the brand, the absolute pinnacle. To offer it at cut-rate prices and especially in the 21st century when lexus has the number 1 market share and a product second to none is a phenomenal blunder. Wake-up Ljflx, wake-up to the 21st Century, look at the changes around you in this beautiful world. Their are so many luxury brands these days that cut-rate pricing is just not going to do it anymore. Remember, Luxury is all about being special and successful. If people need value let them buy Toyota Avalon. Let lsbecome ""premium HELM"""".Although I have only love and respect for your words I must also voice the rational arguments based on sound logic. Again, the ball is in your court, I am fairly confident this time you will not hesitate to agree with me and finally realize that we were on the same page, in agreement all along.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"LOL! I am rolling in splits. This is the funniest post from you in a long time.But humor aside: The reason I am strongly advocating head-to head pricing with A8 and 7 is because now is the time. This is the year of transition and new model change. If prices on ls460 make a quantum leap, customers wont mind, but once you have introduced the model, its very difficult to do that. In between model changes you can only do incremental additions. lsis currently 22% cheaper than 750. I suggest it should make a quantum leap of 12% this fall and then keep increasing prices in increments in following years to bring in line with 7Series and 750Li to make up for the remaining 10%. I am sure when Lexus is educated properly along these lines they will be convinced and success will kiss their feet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lots of familar (old) themes being tossed around I see. How many Lexus fans here have even driven a 745/7Series Sport to even know if the car is tuned for sport? I wonder why most magazines that like softer riding cars like theSClass, LexusLS, and XJ almost always complain about the 7Series Sport's ride? The car is set up as a sporty sedan in its segment, more so than any non AMG S, A8 or non ""R"" XJ. The upcoming S8 will soon join the upcoming S63 as the sporty (if not outright sports sedans) in this class. Claiming what buyers buy these cars for don't change what they are. Lexus being more prestigious than Mercedes and BMW. Is this supposed to be funny? A company that doesn't even control their own home market ain't got no prestige over Europe's ruling luxury car markers - Mercedes-Benz and BMW. Imagine the laughter if Mercedes and BMW were outsold by Lexus in Europe and Germancarfans were to come here and say that MB/BMW are more prestigious. Lexus didn't even become ""Lexus"" in their own country of origin until this year, yet they're supposed to have some type of prestige over Mercedes and BMW. Mercedes and BMW building/selling/marketing their A/B and 1Series cars has not made a radiator grille of difference in their prestige anywhere in the world where they are sold along side thoseSClasss, SLRs, 760Lis, M5s, M6s, 550is and SL65s. This is nothing more than a made up excuse (reaching) to give Lexus some type of advantage because in reality Mercedes makes buses, garbage trucks, taxicabs, and Unimogs, yet that SClass still gets the top spot (unless their is a Rolls or Bentley around) in front of wherever it is parked. Another myth - Mercedes cheapest car is the $29,975 C230 sedan, the truly under 30K hatchback has been gone for a year, and you aren't going to find many 2006 C230s around with non options clinging to that base price. Funny thing is Lexus sells the nearly identical (in hp/price etc.) IS250 for $605 dollars more (30,580) yet that isn't seen as cheap car? Neither car is going to be found in great numbers at those prices. We all know this. Yet if there is a base IS250 or C230 sitting around, they both have a chance at actually selling for less than the magical and oh so prestigious 30K pricepoint. bdr127, Oh don't worry Lexus understands this hence the little 4-cylinder diesel IS model over there, like all those smaller engined C,3,A4 models.

"Lotta desperate sounding Euro cheerleaders here. Sounding a little threatened again I see. Actually Lexus on a whole is better than 90% of todays low quality German product. Mercedes has rotten quality and finally admitted it. BMW now has bad styling and bad reliability and Audi can't move product past 80K units a year here making it near dead last in market. Though, the new swallow-me-whole grill should help that. ? The LexusLS in ultra luxury form is better than SClass or SClass combined. Fit/finish and quality of materials and electronics/ ergonomics ridicule the once shining 3-point star thats now in deep doo-doo. SClass aint nothing unless its on MTV Cribs with 20 inchers. Audi A8's a better car. The ES330 is more luxurious and content rich then the vanilla looking 50KEClass. Lexus doesn't have an SUV that was designed in the Cold War era either and pretend to charge 70K for it. What a joke! ? Just read that Mercedes is now so afraid of the upcoming new super Lexus model threat, that their going to even offer a hybrid SClass version probably licensed from Toyota. Who's copying who now? Lexus will offer a LWB SClass level car next round in the 600 hp range using hybrid technology. The strong Japanese luxury brands should nicely steam roll and flatten the sick & washed up German auto industry just like the Big 2-1/2 were. Mercedes has their priorities sraight you know and is turning it around fighting back. They just unveiled new Nano paint technology to prevent further scratching. I agree 100% that Mercedes, BMW and Audi do sit on a higher level that would be the repair shop lift.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"LexusLS not comparable with S, 7 and A8 ? LOL !! Not according to even the enthusiast magazines. Not only is the LexusLS tested together with these cars, but it came out first & second & the results are not price adjusted, so the LexusLS really did very well against them not because it cost less than the others. Where is theSClass? It's placed last in one & I think 4th in another.And these enthusiast magazines usually are heavily biased towards more sporty & more German feel vehicles too. They also acknowledged that the lsis probably the best equipped of them all, & they didn't even take into account the fact that all the gizmos actually works more flawlessly than those in the European brands as all the surveys known worldwide has showned. Now you don't have to decide what to buy using the rankings in these mags, and as I said before, the most desirable car is in the eyes of the beholder, but saying the lsis not comparable with the 7,S and A8 is plain ridiculous.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lexus really can't lose. Cars like the LexusES and RX combined can outsell other COMPANIES LINEUPS! So Lexus will always have nice sales numbers. The only battle is vertical growth vs. vertical ambition. Lexus knows there is six-figure money waiting for them, it's just how to go about getting it without seeming greedy, and throwing the Baby out with the bathwater. I just don't want Lexus to become another Acura, or really Infiniti for that matter, which really has a glass ceiling of $50k, despite good sales of the M35, which is a $45k car. Lexus should have no limits, and should move confidently, and fairly aggressively, upward. But if the lsmoves north, the GS needs to be improved noticably. Maybe the engine swap will be enough, but I'm not thrilled with the offering, unlike how I felt in 98. DrFill",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Luv ya -- you really police the site, and for that I thank you. Nothing more unpleasant than people resorting to prepubescent behavior when they're talking about cars.As for the Q45 -- everyone here knows I'm a Toyota loyalist, but I try to be honest about things (I love ALL cars anyway, and that helps), and I have to reply to the following: ""The Infiniti Q45 is a wannabe something that we don't know what it wants to be. on the one hand it wants to be a BMW 7Series , on the other hand it want's to be a LexusLS, but in the process it turns into neither and turns into cow dung. Let's see it's as ugly as a Maxima, even looks like one from the front, it's interior is downright a disaster, and even with 340bhp it only does 0-60 in 5 1/5 seconds. Nor is it's handling as great as the 7Series or SClass sport even with 18"" wheels & tires. And it doesn't even handle better than the barge called the LexusLS. The Infiniti Q45 is basically a wannabe BMW-Lexus-Benz for people who can't afford a 740, LexusLS,SClass.""Whew! Let's review our history a minute. The original Q45 was universally praised in the automotive press for its performance and handling -- especially relative to the LexusLS. It's only problems were somewhat controversial styling and a dingbat advertising campaign. Bad launch = bad sales. A shame really, but that's the way it is. When the lsand Q were introduced at the Detroit Auto Show, everybody swarmed over the lsbut stayed away from the Q like the flu -- this before anybody had a chance to drive it, which tells me it was primarily a styling issue (plue the interior didn't look as luxurious as the LS's).Now, two generations later, we have thelatest version, and it sure looks like a winner to me in the performance category -- but the front end looks like an anteater (to me), and that may prove problematic once again. Nissan (and by extension, Infiniti) has had some strange ideas about automotive styling for the last ten years, and it has hurt them more than they're willing to admit.My prescription? Make the cars beautiful. Stop trying to be edgy or ""with it"" and just make them sleek and beautiful. And don't copy ANYBODY (the LexusLS comes immeditately to mind). Someone mentioned the interior -- matter of taste, of course, but every time I see their ad in the magazines I just drool. I think it's beautiful (as is the ls's, which recently won Best Interior by the Automotive Interior Designers association).I notice that most of the 45 baching comes from BMW and Mercedes apologists, by the way. Surprise, surprise.Oh yeah -- someone also mentioned 5.5 seconds to 60 as being kinda wimpy. Dunno where you were in the 60s, but that's big block Chevelle territoy, dude. Check it out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Man we've been at this for a long time, I'd forgotten that we've had the ""life decisions"" conversation before. Imagine me reading that after all these years! I'm sure a high percentage of LexusLS buyers can swing aSClass, especially if they're leasing them. No doubt. I've always wanted to ask what town do you live in, it sounds like quite a place the place. Probably like what Naperville IL is here. The Acura Legend is the reason why I've always had a strong desire to own and Acura, but they just can't seem to get the styling right. edspider1, It really does depend on your circle or group, because to some a Lexus is just that a poor mans Mercedes, and to some it's a better car that doesn't get its just do. Since Lexus does make a great car all they'd have to do to erase that stigma is create their own styling and not follow Mercedes' every move. They probably will do the former, but the latter is just good business. sv7887, Ahh...Jag u wa. Yes, imo the new XJ is a full fledged member of this class. It's light and lean and is easily a styling home run. The only thing I noticed at Detriot is that it still does have anywhere near the room of say a LexusLS or 745Li, so far that hasn't slowed its sales down. I'm not sure about their reliability you'll have to ask one of the survey people about that one. They only Jaguar I truly don't like is the X-Type. The XK is a modern classic. Its about the only other luxury car besides a Mercedes SClass that can wear the same styling since 1997 and still look so good. Jaguar's dual-edged sword is their styling you either like it or you don't. It's either just right or way too much for some, and in the case of the old XJ it made the car very uncompetitive because it simply was too small (low roof etc) for many. M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"LG, I usually can respect most of your posts. But this one has topped them all.You say that the Q7 has a boring ad. Well picture this, an RX350 ad that shows the car driving at night then all of a sudden it crosses paths with a deer. The ad was to highlight the swivel headlights of the RX. Nothing special as every carmaker has them now. No word on the mechanicals of the RX. Not utility. Not seating configurations. Nothing. Haven't even seen ads for the LexusES and IS yet. But they're still running the 1 year old ads on the LS', maybe in an attempt to sell the leftovers, which is brilliant.BTW: The Q7 sales have been much higher than anticipated by Audi, so this one definetely won't be a sales dud. It sold more last month than the MDX, SRX, X5, and RX. Being a new model does help out with this for sure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maxhondayour post is so long that I cant begin to respond to all your points. Just keep this is mind: you are putting words in my mouth regarding Cadillac. I have never said the CAdillac makes better cars than lexus, I never said that Cadillac has a younger clientele than Lexus, I never said cadillac competes better with the Germans than Lexus, the list goes on and on. You are too sensitive when it comes to Lexus and you are on the defensive. The fact remains that Lexus products lack the styling or performace to appeal to younger buyers. The average Lexus owner is probably younger than the average cadillac owner and for that I congratulate you and Lexus. It doesn't change the fact that many young people would take an Audi, BMW, VW or MB over a Lexus. Other than the IS I cant imagine what lexus products you and your friends are attracted to. I'm sure you live in an area with a lot of young web developers who sip starbucks and wear prada loafers and that is fine. However, common sense should (and I say SHOULD) tell you that your area can't be representative othe country because cadillac is third in sales this year and according to you they dont sell any cars in North Jersey. I live in Phila. and I have seen dozens of CTS' so far and I have seen innumerable Escalades and EXTs. I see a lot of everything except Bentleys and Ferraris, but I see those too. Also,my ex-college roomate is 25 and can't stand VW's, Audis or Lexi. To him they represent interner wealth and yuppyism (if that were a word)and he has a Hi tech job outside of Princeton. He hasn tbought a new car but he told me a while ago he would consider a cadillac because he wants something different.You need to do more research and less exaggerating. You say the CTS has finished low in every comparison review you've seen? It finished behind the 330, IS and A4 in C&D but they didnt have much bad to say about the car. The general consensus is that it needs more power and a better interior. Both will be addressed next year and both could be applied to your beloved IS300. You are basically saying that the car is a relative failure but I dont see what you are basing that on, most reviews have been positive.Also, why would the Deville be better than the SClass or 745 when it costs about $15K-$25K less than those cars? Again, please apply some common sense. Your sales price argument continues to be impotent. Like I said before, finacing deals do NOT reduce the price of a car. I will accept your latest argument about caddys being sold near invoice but I will REPEAT that most cadillacs sold cost more than most Lexus models sold. You can talk about financing, incentives, invoice prices and everything else but you cant change that fact. Cadillac has more room to play with its pricing because it makes so much money on its vehicles (about $700 million) and they cost more than Lexus vehicles except for the LexusLS and SC430. BTW, your lexus to BMW/MB comparisons are a joke. YOu honestly believe that an LexusLS competes with teSClass, 7Series or 5Series? Do you really think the ES300 is a competitor to the 3Series? Anyone considering a 3Series is sure as hell not going to consider an ES300 for mny reasons. The CTS may not be perfect but it is much more like the 3 than the ES300 will ever be. I doubt any MB/BMW fanatic (and there are some here) would agree with your lexus-biased comparisons.""$4 billion in capital means nothing if you can't EXECUTE.""Did you not read anything I wrote? Next years intros include a 315hp roadster, a 350hp RWD sedan with 6 speed manual, a new 260hp engine for the CTS and a 315hp AWD American X5..........That doesnt sound like executing you? dude, if you hate cadillac that is you perrogative but you are being ridiculous. Why cant you just acknowledge that they finally have a gamplan. You dont have to like the cars but you cant deny they are taking the right steps.""Bingo. Sales. Isn't that what Cadillac cares about also but can't seem to pull off, increased sales? What else do you think corporate america is about? selling fewer products? ""Cadillac's sales are up about 16% or so this year, again do some research. Also, as i have pointed out before to others their lineup is one of the smallest in the luxury industry. They are holding on to third place with FOUR products.merc1:My statement about Infiniti makes sense. He said that Infiniti ranked above cadillac and I was saying that by ANY measure that wasnt true. You can measure it by sales, by rankings in magazines, by the number of innovations, brand image, average price of vehicles, by awards given or anything else. He cannot back that statement up. Audi sells less cars than caddy but they have a superior image, that cannot be said for Infiniti and I was merely saying that the SIZABLE difference between caddy sales and infiniti sales reflected that. I didnt mean to disappoint you, I didnt realize you were rooting for me.magnetophone:I dont know where you live but cadillacs are not only popular amongst the ""urban"" aka ""poor"" crowds. While many young rappers and atheletes are buying up escalades most cadillacs are bought by older working (or retired) people who are upper middle class like yourself. You say they are cheap? Well I would love to make enough money to call cadillacs cheap. BTW, most ""poor"" people as you call them cant afford a cadillac or any other luxury car. MBs and Bentleys pop up in the driveways of many rappers and NBA players but I don't hear you saying they are only popular in ""poor"" areas. Are you suggesting that anyone with a white collar job or a decent education would buy a caddy? who do you think was buying them before the rappers made the Escalade popular?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"LG, I wouldn't discount the Sonata just yet. With 13k on average monthly sold(or a 8 day supply-splendid for this class), the car is about neck-and-neck with other perenial class fav, the Accord, despite a mild freshening for '06.The car does have a while to go to catch up with previous gen Camry's lofty 400k units, but anything is possible in this business.It has been noted several times by Team Lexusknowseverything that somehow the Euro-car fans are somehow jealous of a car that is just now becoming full-circle, in that I mean delivering what every car in it's class delivers: The balance of performance(complain about ride-biasing all you may), luxury, and comfort. So in a sense, the lsis late to the party. Yes it does have the ultra-plush suspension and tons of creature comforts, but it doesn't offer the total package that it's competitors does, including the XJ.I for one hope that Lexus has gotten it together this time round, but as previously posted, highly doubtful. Take the Camry. The car had a soggy suspension components since the '80s(despite all of the laughable SE monikers), yet it did not get a decent suspension until 2007? And Toyota's about evolution and and innovation? Same for Lexus. Yes they're number 1(due on the most part of the older-set favs LexusES and LS), but being number 1 does not equate to being the best. GM, number one in the world(for now-altho it's been that way for 75 years), does that make them a better producer than Toyota? DCX? Audi/VW AG? Porsche? BMW? Even Jag? Absolutely not. Not a one of them with the current product(save for Vette/XLR, STSv-/CTS-v, Solstice/Sky, large SUV's that they have out now on all of their numerous brands(poor SAAB).With that said, once again the lsis going to be another phenomenal success for the company, but the Second Coming? Doubtful! Will Armageddon come when the LS460 hits showroom this fall? A very minute chance! Will DCX shutter the production of the World's Luxury SClass because of fret that the lswill reign supreme everywhere, including it's homeland Europe(Germany)? Now that's a statement that is utterly impossible.....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maybe I'm missing something here, but if HP has been such a huge determining factor, then why did the previous Lexus lsstill kick butt, in spite of its HP rating? I question that HP has been all THAT important in the mix of so many other factors. Now that fuel efficiency has become a larger consideration, I think that HP will become even LESS of a concern. The very fact that the LS600hybrid will offer a significant HP rating will be ICING on the cake for those buyers . . . because I'd bet large that the LS600hybrid would sell well even if the HP were not so stunning, provided it was not deficient. The LS600hL will be, in essence, an ultimate vehicle, and the HP will be MORE than adequate.TagMan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"MB is certainly giving Lexus a lot of pricing room for a higher level car than the LexusLS. I recently was in the market for a high-end vehicle and seriously considered the LexusLS and the SClass. I ended up buying an LexusLS with the Custom Luxury package. MSRP is about $67,000. The MSRP of an SClass equiped similarly would be about $98,000. I liked the SClass better than the LexusLS in some important ways, but in most respects the LexusLS is a superior vehicle, imo, not even considering price. I could see a market for a Lexus with a price just below $100K, but what features would such a car have that would justify the price? More power, sure, but how much could they charge for that, especially if it is achieved via the hybrid route.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"MB losing their marbles ? Geez... Who would have thunk dat ??? My trip to Japan was disappointing in terms of learning more about the Lexus plans sans 2005. Seemed like many people are resigned to having re-badged Toyotas as Lexi in Japan in 2005. At least to the ones I talked to, they seemed ambivalent about buying rebadged Toyota's as Lexi when Lexus becomes an official brand. They also say that Lexus will be a huge success in Japan when it becomes official. For sure, the only car anyone can certify will be new design in 2005 is the 2006 GS. Else, some feel that the LexusLS, IS and RX will be carry-over Toyota models as they are in 2004. I do not believe this tho', so I have requested for more detective work and a friend has promised to dig more and get the stuff to me shortly, so I am waiting !A 600HP MB ? Not anything new these days ? Its all about HP with MB. New design looks like destined to the dogs, electronics that we know won't work as advertised, and a brand over-promising and under-delivering will finally get what its due sooner rather than later. Its only a matter of time now !!!The LF-X is not even remotely close to the FX, I agree with you completely. If Lexus ever makes that car, they'll sell every one made, I'd wager.Designman: Yeah, the stakes for Lexus to deliver the LF-S and LF-C are high indeed ! Everyone is waiting and watching. If they ever do, the US lux car playing field as we currently know it would be forever changed AGAINlexusguy: Yeah, great moniker. Fits quite well these days. I'd rather be a lexusguy than an MB, BMW, Audi or VW-guy !!! These manufacturers seemed to not have a clue where they are heading... Just MHO, of course....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"menekseIs there a reason you didn't consider a Q45? My personal limit I can spend on a car is about $55K, and after driving anEClass, 530, A6 and a Q45, I was surprised at how much I liked the Q. My local Lexus dealer had a used LexusLS (6K miles) that I test drove, and I was kind of disappointed in how it drove and handled. I ultimately decided on and preordered an Infiniti G35, which I had went to see at the Detroit car show, but will get a Q instead if I don't like the G35. My biggest problem with the Q is that the center pod on the dashboard is kind of ugly and the trunklid is flimsy & has cheap hinges. The Q's technology interface is not as aesthetic as the BMW's, but did seem to work well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lsand GS are entirely different cars aimed at different market segments. If the GS cannibalizes the LexusES I doubt anyone at Lexus would mind. But they too are entirely different cars/markets and I doubt there is any cannibalization going on. You had a ton of pent-up demand for the GS and the lsis coming off some real high sale months a year ago when it had its refreshing. It's on its normal track to sell 30K cars.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Merc, You do have a point there. tiag_M5 has repeatedly said the LexusLS is UNSAFE because of the exclusion of a single airbag. No question all high end marques will fare better, but this goes to show the difference that an airbag will make using a common benchmark. You will agree all cars in the compact class have similar build quality? If so, then you will agree the marginal effects of such side airbags will also be accurately shown. The VW Beetle is a superbly engineered car, but the side impact airbags didn't make a difference. In the Corolla case, it made only a marginal difference. The key here is the structure is the No 1 line of defense in a crash. It goes to show that a single airbag does not make one car safer than the other. No doubt Lexus is slower to adopt these measures, but I take issue with calling these cars unsafe because of the exclusion of a SINGLE device. ALL of these arguments can be used to call the Jaguar unsafe too. Will you accuse Jaguar of cutting corners as well? We all now know the Frame of the lsis used in classrooms for its design. The crash tests have shown that the lshas performed equally well. In my comment to snobbery I was referring to the ""being first in innovation, Prestige, history"" and other arguments used to put down Lexus. I was not referring to the side airbag. The only criticism which I think is valid is styling. Lexus doesn't market to the BMW crowd with the LexusLS, so being #1 in the skidpad, Horsepower, and 0-60 aren't going to be expected. In the fifteen years of reading Lexus test drives the car performs somewhere in the middle. What Lexus' focus is Customer Service, Reliability, cutting edge electronics and cloud like ride. Despite this, the lsalways places highly on Auto Rags reviews..Don't get me wrong, Mercedes is a great car. Once they get their quality issues sorted I'd probably buy one. What I don't get is all this hype about their styling..Jaguar still wins that one hands down..BMW's look terrible these days and Audi is okay. Lexus needs alot of work in this regard, as I don't like their styling direction at all. But then again, I can't even remember the last good looking Japanese car I saw recently..(Mazda RX-8?) Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and hardly a reason to slam a marque as being inferior. SV",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Merc, ??For once we agree...Lexus at this point is going on hype at least exterior design wise..I have yet to see them turn out a real awe inspiring design. The RX was a glimmer of hope though..I am not impressed at all with the GS..The rear looks awfully close to an older Toyota Avensis. I only can hope the 07 lsis better. If it isn't I'll seriously consider buying an Euro brand. I think these design issues stem from the rush for ""Futuristic"" designs..The whole Traditional look seems to be out..The only reason I think the Hybrid drivetrains will be more popular than the MB Diesels, is the novelty of it all..The Prius has created a buzz in showrooms, and Lexus will be able to take advantage of it. It's a new concept, rather than a tried and tested Diesel. I'm not discounting the MB Diesel, but we're used to them. Diesels aren't especially popular in the US, just as Manual Transmissions are not. As a Lexus owner, I'm obviously partial to the brand..But I'm willing to concede the drawbacks of them..So far I think styling continues to be one. My own personal feeling is that the build quality has slipped from the original. Many a Lexus mechanic have told me that Lexus doesn't build cars like they used to..I feel the same way having owned lscars from the beginning for Long durations..Long term quality is going to suffer in the face of this race to cram electronics into cars..SV",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maxhonda:I stand corrected about the RX300's sales but I still maintain that Lexus will continue to fall down the sales list. Lexus vehicles have no sense of style and they are no longer the bargains they used to be because the other automakers continue to come out with lower priced luxury vehicles to increase sales. The new Rx300 isnt going to make nearly the impact of the first one. When the first one came out it had no competition except the ML320. Next year the RX will compete with the X5, ML, SRX, Envoy, XC90 and MDX. IN other words the competition will be much stiffer. CAdillac is right behind Lexus this year in sales, BMW is first, ad the SRX will be enough to push it past lexus next year or the year after. The SRX fills a major hole in the lineup and unlike the RX300 it will be something new and fresh. Cadillac's lineup is smaller and older than Lexus' lineup and it's still close to lexus in sales. Once you add the ESV, XLR and SRX it wll be good position to pass lexus. The new GS and RX are replacement models, not an expansion of lexus lineup.How old is old? I am talking 50s and 60s. I have seen many Deville drivers who looked to be in their 40s or early 50s. Most LexusLS drivers ae beyond retirement in this area. I think they went from Buicks to the LexusLS. To be honest, the lexus model I hear the most about from people my age is the RX300. The LexusES is horrible looking (also a favorite of guys in their 60s), the GS is dated and the RX looks like a civic with big wheels. On styling alone I think BMW, MB and CAdillac will outsell cadillac next year. BTW, BMW has four models coming out next year and two of those will be affordable. If you erase the Lexus price advantage it starts to lose its luster compared to the prestigous German marques.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"May be not. It was just a radical suggestion. I think lexus should focus more on high end (LX, LS) and enter the $100K+ heaven and convert more buyers towards sporty IS rather than LexusES, so that in future lexus has more sporty personality than now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Merc:Your comment about Aluminum and what Brightness said is totally unfair and incorrect....He has pointed that out to you, yet you continue to come back to the same OLD LINE over and over again..Not Nice, Not accurate and Not very Honest on your part.TO BE CLEAR...He said Aluminum is less save then Steel...not that the A8 is less safe then an lsor any other specific car...Reason being Aluminum is more brittle and because of that doesn't Crumple as well as Steel...it also has a lower burn point then steel.(This is from memory and if brightness thinks I have misquoted him I hope he will correct me.)I personally know nothing about the Properities of Aluminum but it seems Brightness does...and You have not posted anything to factually refute what he has said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Merc? Are you talking about the GT3 and RS for ALMS? To me the CGT has the Boxster styling genes. However, Porsches are Porsches so I guess we&#146;re splitting hairs.I like the look of those bolt-studded wheels on the S but these low profile tires are getting out of hand as fashion. Jeez, they&#146;re for racing on smooth race tracks? I can&#146;t imagine anyone wanting a luxury barge with them. I don&#146;t even like them on the sports cars unless, as I said, they&#146;re for track. For driving, I like the 17s on the Boxster and 911. You can&#146;t even get 17s anymore on a 911 and Boxster S. Even some track rats seem to prefer the 18s. By the way, I think I could like those fender flares on the MB S if only they blended them into the fenders with a nice wide-radius filet. It&#146;s those hard edges that are really out of whack and jarring IMO. I think you will notice that the shots of the S that are most attractive are the ones where the lighting de-emphasizes the hard edges on the flares.Yes, I can&#146;t wait for the new LexusLS. I am also very curious to see how the IS will sell, especially since they are really marketing the power of the 350 in their advertising. And I think we could see next 7 a year before the 7-year life cycle. Ditto with the 5 unless there is a considerable face lift. Scott? we can ignore that ground clearance on the Panamera concepts? it looks in the league of the super cars such as Ferraris, Lambos and CGT? it just ain&#146;t happening. As a matter of fact, I believe the final design will look considerably different. I think they released the sketch just to create some visual interest to accompany the announcement that they are officially proceeding with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Merc1 - I don't know if this car makes it or not. It's reviewed pretty in-depth in todays NY Times and while the review isn't bad, it isn't overly impressive either. Overall it seems like a good car but VW missed on some basic non-automootive conveniences like cup holders, the CD player and the nav system pretty badly per the reviewer. MB can blow these things (not that they do) and still hit a homer because of their image and well established brand. VW can't. It seems that leases for this car are already heavily subsidized by VW and can be gotten at $697 per month in some areas. I know people who wish they could get $8-10k cheaper ls's and E-500's at that price. Heck I bet your hard pressed to get an E-320 at that price. I know my $51K GX is more expensive than that as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Merc1 said ""There is no way a Q45 is %95 of those cars, they simply out-class, and outdo the Q45 is way too many areas. If it were truly that way the Q would be a lot more popular like the car that truly is closer to being a high percentage of what the competition offers, that car being the LexusLS.""..............?I disagree that with this simplistic stance, using sales as the determining factor. (Merc1, based on sales figures, your Mitsubishi is not a very strong car either, but I assume that you like it)The Q45 does offer many similar attributes to other cars. They may have missed on the styling and curb appeal, but it is a very nice car with lots of content and a nice power train. On a lease basis it is ""a nice drive""... and it does offer similarities to some of the more costly cars in this class. Do I like the new A8 better? Sure, I may even buy one. But, the Audi also costs about 15k more when similarly equipped.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"merc1 said:I really couldn't care less what type of house, jewelry or anything else you buy/haveTRUE!ljflx - All the money in the world won't make your opinion any more credible than anyone else's. It just might get some more fanfare, but that's it. If you've really made a TRUE success of yourself, than you should already have learned that lesson in life. No reason to compromise yourself like that . . . especially since so many of your posts are more balanced and interesting. I often enjoy your ""business"" perspectives as well as your opinions.As for the HELMS . . . sure, the cookie cutter styling is rampant. And, not too long after I had read that the nextEClass was going to be different than the new SClass . . . last week I saw a spy photo of what is likely to be the newEClass . . . and guess what? . . . it looks like it has borrowed a LOT from the styling cues of the newSClass. Here we go again! I guess I shouldn't be surprised.BTW, the X-Type Jag is history. One more model year perhaps, but then the ax, thank goodness. It is NOT an XJ! The S-Type DOES have different styling (although I hate it), and there is word of a radically different XJ possibly around 2009. IMO, the XJ has been an historical lesson and icon for gorgeous styling. They should have NEVER made the X-Type to cheapen it.Also, IMO, the 5Series BMW IS truly a beautiful automobile, from a design standpoint and performance standpoint. Few come close. It's a terrific ""all-in one"".The new lsis an improvement, no doubt, and will represent itself well in the marketplace. There is no way that Lexus is the only company guilty of the ""cookie-cutter-syndrome"". I think the newest styling is somewhat ""subdued"", but it is now clearly adequate, and I think Lexus styling is ""easy on the eye"" in a certain sense because of that. It's a safe, and perhaps smart, place to be in the marketplace.TagMan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Merc - I'm with you on the SC430 vs Solara. I posted ages ago that I couldn't figure out what Toyota was thinking on that one. I believe Syswei and I both thought that was a mistake and hurt the SC430. Still we are only talking a 30K difference there vs $200+ large in the Maybach case. But yes Toyota is dumb - IMO - for doing the Solara as an SC430 wannabe. I never made an ES330/Avalon connection (I guess your looking at a price connection) to be honest because the real connection is the Camry. I've never been an ES330 fan and I don't ever remember posting anything all that positive about it (other than it hits the mark given its annual 75-80K sales, something you've also said if I remember right). When I get a loaner on service days it's always the RX I request. I bought my mother two straight V6 Camry's. The Camry is a great car (performance excluding) but the LexusES needs greater differentiation to get my attention.Anyway have a happy and safe 4Th as I may not post again until next week. We're still buddies and always will be despite differences of opinion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Merc, ??I can agree with you about the lslooking similiar to the last generationSClass. As much as this trend annoys me, I still have to agree with the others in saying that the current SClass and the new 430 don't have similiar styling cues. ??While we're on this topic...Don't you all think the exterior cues are converging across automakers? Footie posted a picture of a Ford Taurus andEClass some weeks back, and there was some resemblance. With the exception of Jaguar, I don't really see a nice looking design out there. MB used to make some awesome timeless designs with their SClass and oldSClasses of the late 80's. Lexus' first designs (LS, LexusES, SC) were great, but they've resorted to ""borrowing"" styling cues from MB as of late. (With the exception of the RX). BMW's 7Series isn't bad, but the back of it just looks too ""busy"" for me.. What do you all think?Cheers, SV",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Merc1, I really enjoyed reading your report and hearing your viewpoints. Sounds like Lexus is finally coming up some with vehicles that appeal to you in some respects (beyond reliability, which is a given).I didn't make it to the NY area event myself, unfortunately. But then, the IS isn't really my cup of tea. Now, when Lexus or MB has an event with the new-generation lsand S, I'll make more of an effort to go.I am curious, now that you've been to the event, if you had the money to buy a new 2006 model in the 3/IS/C/A4/G class, but not enough for a M or AMG type, what would you pick? Same question for the 5/GS/E/A6/M. From your report it sounds like the 3 or IS, and the 5?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"merc1, I respect your dialog and insight but your statement ""car like a ES330 and LexusLS are no different in theme (not execution) from a Avalon or Camry"" is a bit much. The Camry, Avalon and ES330 are all engineered off of the same Toyota front-wheel drive platform. The only Lexus vehicle that is possibly comparable to the rear-wheel drive LexusLS is the Lexus GS - at least from a basic platform. Like you, I still love MB cars (and German car driving dynamics in general). I own a MB SClass (R129), in addition to a Lexus LexusLS, 4x4 Suburban and some other vehicles. I own different vehicles because of different needs and desires plus for multiple home locations that dictate unique recreational or diving situations. I plan on keeping our SClass for ages but am somewhat waiting for the new SClass (2005) and new ls(2006) and will then most likely make a purchase decision between the two. I have by far owned more German cars then any others and still keep looking at the current MBSClass. I just love the torque and power of the supercharged V12 and the amazing handling of a car of its size. Unlike others, if I was to purchase another SClass it would almost certainly be the SClass not a SClass V8 offering. Unfortunately, I have just hear and known of too many electronic and other issues with the current SClass but keep trying to convince myself that maybe they have finally fixed them. I still long for the days when MB engineering was more mechanical instead of electronic. Also, I am somewhat put off by the spy photos of the new SClass since I just love the looks of the current generation. Anyway, keep up the MB information coming - I really appreciate your posts. Like you I love their driving dynamics and beautiful designs. And if you know any current generation SClass owners I would love to talk to them. Quite a while back I posted a query on the SClass board for SClass owners and got zero replies. JF",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"merc1, Interesting observations from the Detroit Auto Show press/industry previews. I actually attended the Washington DC Auto Show this last weekend and am planning on going to the Detroit Show the weekend of the 18th. I will also be going to the NYC show in April since it is just a quick train ride from my NYC/NJ apartment. At first, I was puzzled by the new MY06 GS but the more I look at the pictures and read about the upgraded technology, AWD and euro-driving intentions the more interested I get. One thing that troubles me is that I expected the new GS to be a MY05 car not MY06. The official press information just says the car will be available in 2005 but does not say what month. A MY06 designation would seem to say it will in October 05 or at least the later half of the year. However, I am still not sure what they are doing with the final new GS exterior design. As ljflx stated, this means that the new lswill not be until MY07 which I assume means either October 2006 or April 2006 at the earliest. I still am holding on to our lsand was hoping to replace it with the new lsin October 2005 (as a MY06 release). My wife really liked the silver 2004 lswe saw at the Washington Show but I believe that it will look really dated when the MY07 lscomes out. However, I feel Lexus really did improve the looks of the MY04 lswith only minor exterior revision. Until we really spent some serious time looking at it in silver (the color my wife would want) I had only seem a few at a distance on the highway. As for BMW, I share ljflx's and your observations. I have had BMW's over the years and really like the last generation 7Series. My bottom line is that BMW is not even on my list of consideration anymore. I just wish that I had purchased the last generation 750Li before they came out with the current 7Series abortion. By the way, I travel to Switzerland for business and the BMW 7Series is having even more sales problems there then here and it use to basically be BMW's best per-capita market. Since I have always purchased all of my cars/trucks I typically try to wait for the new completely revised model before making a new purchase. In the case of the new 7Series that proved to be a big mistake. I did come very close to purchasing a MB SClass a few months ago but was put off by all of the horror stories I keep hearing about MB having a lot of trouble with their computerized electronics. And, of course, the SClass basically has all of them. I was also put off buy the fact that MB excluded the SClass from the special 2.9% financing deal. One other observation from the Washington Show, my wife and I did like the looks and feel of the Audi A8 L but not the VW Phaeton. The VW just left us both cold except for the interior. Also, the Audi is about 800 lb lighter with the same engine and overall size. As for your comment on the Lincoln pick-up, I could not agree more. What the hell does anyone want (yet alone need) a Lincoln or Cadillac pick-up. Give me a break! And, I am actually getting ready to buy a new Dodge Ram for my place in Texas. I enjoy you guys feed back and opinions. Please keep it up. Jim",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In that same post you declare the "" the LX 470, GX, RX....all re badged and underpowered Toyota's. they are in and of themselves not a bad vehicles....but is this a ""Luxury Brand""....rebadged Toyota's????""In post 8056 (this reply) the RX is now the Highlander. Even more oddly, you said the new Audi A8 is made ""completely of aluminum"". What kind of hyperbole is that? It's got an all aluminum space frame - but does it have an all aluminum engine, gas tank, jack, headlight lenses, windows, seats, CD player?World class baloney and a trail of hyperbole. There's a big difference between luxury brands and luxury things. Luxury brands work as intended by the seller, while luxury goods work as intended by the customer.Remember, Rolex and Mercedes. One great jewelery and a so so watch. The other great jewelry and a so so car. Luxury brands, not luxury goods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"merc1,What did your last post say? You basically said that Lexus sells more cars because they are cheaper. Correct? The lsI didn't include because well, it obviously does sell better than the SClass this year. Now that could be because it is cheaper or it could not be. Do you really have any concrete proof it sells in bigger volumes because it is cheaper? I gave the RX vs. ML and C-class vs. ES330 as examples of where your *theory* is quite simply incorrect. Why was your *theory* incorrect? I stated it before-If as you state Lexus cars sell solely on the basis of price advantage vs. Mercedes, then the ES330 or the RX shouldn't be outselling the C-class and ML-class, since the prices of the C-class vs. ES330 and ML320 vs. RX are quite similar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He is a Frenchie and thus Euro-biased! His BMW experience has certainly ended any prospect of ever owning a Bimmer. He will consider the M35 which is in his price range ($40K-ish). He said the RL is too big (and priced out of his range), hence the TL is a probability. He will also consider the E as well. Anyway, he has sometime to wait for the ideal replacement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Merc1: Did not get R&T yet, but July Motortrend with a comparo of the new Q, LexusLS, Vanden Plas, A8, the base S, and the Seville STS arrived last night. The Q held up well, overall, but there were some serious complaints. The reviewers feel that either Nissan got the horsepower wrong or the drivetrain was not right for the engine. Nissan's response was that the testers were pre-production models. MT was going to reserve final comment until it got a production model. MT also said that the instrumentation panel and navigation equipment was difficult to use, a complaint they usually reserve for the Mercedes.The Mercedes came out on top overall. MT really blasted the ls's styling and ride, but praised the luxury, overall performance and stereo. The A8 did very well, as did the Jag.Interestingly, the STS which was priced almost 30k less than the Jag and 15k less than the cheapest of the other four, did the best time on the skid pad and came close to the top in acceleration and braking distance. MT thought the STS wanted in luxury and ride feel compared to the others but gave it a lot of respect, especially considering the cost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Merc1: ""A lsdoing 60 mph in the 4 second range will *probably* never happen""I guess we'll see if an lscan make a low 4s 0-60mph. The 2004 already is under 6s, with no engine change just going from a 5-speed to a 6-speed tranny. So with a 38% hp increase from 290hp to 400hp, and no significant increase in weight, a low 5s, and even sub-5s is a real possibility for such an engine. Yes, in general Lexus is a very conservative company, but if you listen to Clements last press release, they are looking to change that. They are clearly intending to target BMW in their new releases starting MY2006, and will include a performance tuning unit. That alone spells a huge change, that Lexus will produce factory-tuned performance-luxury cars, along the same lines as the M and AMG. I guess they are now shedding their conservative approach to a fairly more aggressive stance. And about time too.Styling changes. Witness the 2006 GS. Regardless of what many think, vanilla styling it is NOT. RX400H engine is a certainty as the future move is into hybrid technology, and Toyota/Lexus is in the lead here. A 400+bhp engine can be done, and *probably* will be done. Who knows what the specs will be on that engine ? Maybe low 5s (0-60), or even low 11s in the 1/4-mile ! Lexus knows it must shed its current luxo-cruiser image to grow, and they have the will, the money and the determination to do what it takes. And if history is any judge, they will meet and beat expectations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mercedes should stop producing soooooo many new models. jesus! it seems as though every week, poop! out comes a new mb model out of Germany. Has anyone seen the ""MST"" Rumor on germancarfans.com? They say MB is planning on rolling out a new ""sport"" crossover, which is more SUV than the GST. It seriously looks like a Nissan Murano.Lately, I've been disapointed with the direction MB, not BMW, is heading towards. Have any of you been to the LA Auto Show? Stop by the new 2005 CLS-Vision on display. I could have sworn it wasy designed by Honda or another Japanese company. The front: looks like a Q45 (which isn't repsectable at all in my opinion), and the rear: not typical of a german car. I really don't understand why so many people find the CLS to be more gorgeous than the new 645Ci (according to autospies, and other websites).I think Mercedes-Benz should spend more time on what they already have, and try to beef up quality and design, rather than build so many new designs, and have them suffer from quality issues and complaints. contrary to Audi, which in my opinion, has one of the best quality and design (even compared to Lexus). I was really impressed with the whole, intire line, partic. the new A8L. That baby is drop-dead gorgeous.As usual, the LexusLS ultra-lux brought a lot of people around it, and i overheard a couple of people who said the LexusLS had better value than theSClass/SClass. But i don't want to get into that issue...I'm really starting to get disapointed with Mercedes-Benz lately.

The C-Class is going through a model change that happens early next month. That couldn't possibly have any affect on sales. The CL and S after being facelifted for 2003 and posting better numbers than in 2002 shouldn't possibly slow down this year. Makes sense. The ML being the exact same age as the Lexus GS shouldn't see a sales drop either. Makes sense. The Lexus GS selling a whopping 69 GS430s in March shouldn't worry anyone at Lexus, I mean really the GS is only facing about a 1/2 dozen newer entries (like the ML is with the Touareg/GX470/Cayenne/X5 etc) so sales of the GS should remain the same, but MB is in trouble with the ML. Makes sense. Mercedes and BMW are finished, while Lexus goes for ""exclusivity"" with the GS430 which is rarer than the VW Phaeton, Audi A8L, Infiniti Q45 and M45, and Acura RL all of which are considered sales duds, but the GS430 isn't. The age of the GS430 couldn't be the reason for this. No way. These other cars are just ""better"". M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Merc, ??I wasn't accusing you of saying a lswas no match for theSClass. That accusation was meant for someone else. I haven't said anywhere that the lsdesign is original. However, I did say the newest Lexus designs seem to be. I'm using examples of the RX , LexusES, and GX. The pictures of the new GS seem to corroborate my point. ""What I do see people complaining about is the control of the body and the handles that results from that compared to a German car. Who is going to complain about a smooth ride if the handling is up to snuff, that doesn't make sense. You're saying that suspension feel doesn't matter? You're kidding right? That is what makes a car ""drive"" the way it does. German cars have this in spades, hence their following.""Question is, do lsowners complain about this? Using your argument, it can be said that the lsfollowers in fact DO like their smooth rides. I think it's the German followers who have a problem with it, not the lsowners. I'm not a suspension expert, but I'm going to guess that you probably sacrifice the smoothness of a ride when you go for sharper handling. (Correct me if I'm wrong) You make it sound like the lshandles like the 747 while the German cars handle like a F-22. Having driven both cars, the difference is perceptive, but not especially drastic. I really think this whole Handling issue is greatly blown out of proportion. I've said this repeatedly, those seeking a superb performance car would probably opt for a M5 or XJR. Also, unless you plan on racing these cars, it's just a pointless argument.As for Demographics..The avg price of a lsisn't 55-60K. Even the typical base model is $58K. The common midrange one will cost around $65-67K. (I'm sure these prices have changed somewhat since I bought mine in '02). At $67K it's not that big of a step to anSClass. Those paying $73K probably can step up to the base SClass. That's all that I was trying to accomplish. I preach about JDP and CU assessment b/c they consider the practical aspects of owing the car. I've always found that the testing criteria of Car and Driver and others to be unrealistic. Like I'm really going to take corners at 100+ MPH..Does anyone know what percentage of these cars are leased and financed? SV",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"michael_mattox:the two cars/ engines have totally different characters.LS: comfortable and refinedA8: sporty and dynamicCompare it to the M5/M6 engine: V10, 5liters, 507 HP@7750rpm, 383 ft-lbs@6100rpmThe A8 short and long wheelbase are supposed to be the same from 0-60 (6.3s), based on the audiusa website. Either that is a little too optimistic for the long wheelbase or too slow for the short wheelbase. Alright, after reviewing the German Audi website, I found out that the A8 SWB goes from 1-100kph in 6.3s and the LWB takes 6.4s. Because 0-100kph equals 0-62mph, in order to be fair, you have to take off 0.1 or 0.2 seconds off to get the 'real' 0-60 time. Also, don't forget that the A8 is AWD which will slow it down in pure acceleration compared to the LexusLS. However AWD gives you better traction at the limit.What does that mean? If you ask me? NOTHING. How many luxury car owners in here take their car regularly on the track? How many have driven their lsor whatever on a track? There is nothing to prove it, my opinion is that the A8 will be faster driven at the limit. And I don't mean pure acceleration. Speed in curves is more important on a track.Really people, the way most people drive these cars, they only get the cars to 60-70% of their potential. It's more about knowing that you could if you wanted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"                There is only one thing wrong with your airbag rebuttal, you're using much smaller and far less well built cars in your example.  Those cars have absolutely nothing to do with the cars mentioned on this board.  They're not nearly as big or well built.  Now earlier when tiag_m5 showed you results about various Toyotas you said they were invalid because they weren't Lexuses, so you can't point to an Elantra to make a point here either. I don't think anyone said that an airbag would compensate for a lacking structure or that any car here had a poor structure.  The point of paying more for a luxury car is to have all the latest safety features, especially compared to  cheaper cars in this case that have those rear side airbags.  Same thing about paying more money should get you a more reliable vehicle.  You can't seperate the two because Lexus isn't a safety leader.  The issue isn't even that MB or whoever had rear side airbags first, the issue is that Lexus still doesn't have them on what is supposed to be their top-of-the-line sedan. I think tiag_m5 brought the airbags up at this point just to illustrate how things are glossed over and deemed unimportant by the Lexi who simply can't admit that even their lsdoesn't have every base possible covered.  Reading this board you'd think Lexus has thought of everything.  To say that side airbags are in place for bragging rights is the most ridiculous thing I've read in the last few weeks. Is roll-over protection on a convertible no big deal either? M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I personally think they have the best looking vehicles of any high-line car company right now.

"                They named the BMW 7Series ""2003 All-Star Luxury Car Over $40,000"".  In 2002 it was the LexusLS.  In 2001 it was the LexusLS.There are probably some MB fans who are thinking, ""if they didn't pick the S, Automobile Magazine's criteria must be flawed"".  Hardly.  It just means that their criteria are DIFFERENT from yours, not necessarily ""right"" or ""wrong"".I have always said that Lexus tilts toward luxury over sport.  ljflx has said that in his opinion, the lswith euro suspension ""easily outhandles"" the base S.  But we also know that Lexus doesn't do anything like theSClassorSClass.  So I think is fair to say the the ls(base) starts more on the luxury side of the spectrum and MB (S55) can be had more on the sport side, and that there might be some overlap in the middle (LS euro vs S base).If an individual buyer's definition of the ideal car is tilted more toward luxury and less toward sport, he can get an lsnon-euro and it can be ""best"" FOR HIM.  If his definition of the ideal car is more sporty, he can get an MB sport edition orSClassor BMW or whatever, and it can be ""best"" FOR HIM.

"                They may have disagreed in '98 or '99, but as I said before, once the A6 received actual horsepower, it was all over for GS as far as the mags were concerned. The '06 GS is the best one yet, but it still has the same fundamental problem that has been plauging the car since 1993. Lexus keeps over promising and under delivering with an akward car that has to find a small niche between the LexusES and LexusLS. In fairness to BMW, that picture was not the most flattering I could find, but it fit the size and angle requirements to fit with the others. Here is a much better one, along with a similar GS photo:http://www.zett-eins.de/bilder/z540%20015.jpghttp://carad.ebayimg.com/i20/01/a/07/04/a9/77_4.JPGWhile the previous 5 was hardly my favorite car interior, in my opinion it definitely bests the extremely flat and boring GS interior (CR called it ""antiseptic""), which could easily have come from Accord town.

"                Things like steering feel, ride quality, looks- are pretty subjective. There are many who would say that the 745Li rides better than the MB, Lexus, Audi, etc- but then again, Car and Driver said that ""the Lexus ride is unmatched in this group"" when compared to the BMW, MB, Jag, Audi, etc. These subjective qualities do not make one manufacturer better than another. But quality, reliability, safety, technology, fuel efficiency, and value do contribute to how good one manufacturer is vs another. And in these areas, Lexus matches or surpasses all of it's competitors. You cannot compare a  SClass to the ls- it's $20-25K more; nor can you compare the SL500 to the SC430- it's also $25K more. The fact that the Lexus can even be compared to another vehicle that costs 30-40% more is a testament to it's greatness. I'm not a german auto basher, or lexus aficionado. But my wife and I have owned several of these vehicles- '95 LexusLS, '97 M3, '00 CLK430, '01 CLK55, '01 M5, '01 a8 and now a GS400/ RX /Boxster S- and while I enjoyed the driving characteristics of the M's and Boxster, I'd be a moron to say that BMW and MB is somehow ""superior"" to Lexus. Each does things a bit differently and focuses on different buyers, and each does a fine job in their own way. But in terms of a pure ""luxury"" vehicle, I still think the LexusLS is unmatched at it's real-world price.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This can somewhat be excused because of their relatively short time thus far as global players, but the blatant rip-offs of Japanese and European designs always pale to the originals and make them look as second rate as they still are. The worst of which that comes to mind is the Kia Sorento, which steals so much from the RX300 that I was a little surprised Toyota didnt take them to court over it.

"                This is upsetting to me.  To me, buying a luxury car and holding it for a long time was my favorite strategy.  It made me feel like I was using my capital wisely, while still enjoying a fine driving experience.  It was an especially good strategy for me since I am a low mileage user (and even more so in recent years since I injured my back). ?Real life example:  in 1987, I bought a 1 yr old 735 BMW for $31K cash (big first year depreciation on 7s in those days!).  I kept it until 1998 when I traded it in for about $5,000 off on a new MB E320 (again paying cash).  So my cost for driving a great car was about $180/month (yes, I know, plus the time value of money)! ?Admittedly, the numbers are different these days, but the point is the same.  That's why I just bought an '05 lsfor cash instead of another MB this time-- I plan on holding it for long time.  But if Pablo is right and nobody is going to bother building cars that hold up long term anymore, I will end up paying $700+/month like all the lessees.  And I don't really care about getting a new car every 3 or 4 years if I can be driving a fine older one (with low mileage in my case). ?Please Lexus, don't try and follow the path of ""planned obsolescence"".  Toyota didn't get where it is by selling short-term fashion plates cheaper than the Germans.  There is still a market for people who want quality.  Otherwise, Pablo is right and I would lease an S over an LS(I still love the look and feel of the former), and just dump it every 3 years (and hope I get one that doesn't have to be in the shop too often even in those first 3 years!).

                tiag m5 great links.the links you provided show the photo i was trying to find.  the SClass being T boned bya WEDGED SHAPE battering ram.  it is amazing how safe the SClass is.  hats of to MB. i wish i could find some photos of the A8 being tested. i can't prove this in anyway but i truly feel that Toyota and Lexus design their vehicles to perform well in the standard tests but not for real world collisions.hey guys the lsis a fine car but for me it is not equal to the S. ask yourself what's more important.....CR's blessing or surviving a violent crash.  as for the price difference between the SClass and the LexusLS.  i think a couple of things are being omitted.  the S was awd and also the long wheelbase version.  these two options alone don't make up the complete dollar difference but i would think it changes the equation by 5k.  tiag m5...i had an 03 M5.  fantastic automobile.the only car i have ever missed after i sold it.            ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Tiag M5, you obviously own a Mercedes. I own two Audis, a Lexus, and a Honda. I love them all. But, you can't just be the only one on this forum to defend Mercedes forever. Sure, the S has a lot of safety features, but it really doesn't make a GIGANTIC difference as you've streched it to be. And, it's not like the S could always outdo the lsin a crash. They're only cars, and it depends on the human conditions, not the 14 airbags. The Lexus/Toyota Co. surely does innovate on safety; they were the first company to have backup cameras and headlights that turn with the wheel, and they do have good airbags, like the knee airbags being added to their revamped models. You have to have information to back up your frivolous comments; that's just trying to defend poor dwindling Mercedes. I'd rather own a BMW than a Mercedes, but I'd rather own an Audi than a BMW. And, I'd rather own a Lexus than a Mercedes or BMW also. Japan always has, and always will have, better all-around technologies than Germany. Our A6 and A4 seem prehistoric in features compared to the  RX . Not the Honda, though, 'cause its a stripper. Mercedes is no longer a dominant manufacturer, and do not completely excel in anything, people of the US are slowly realizing that.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                This is more like it, Merc1... Good one.On paper at least the LS460 makes the S450, 750, A8 and XJ all seem pointless, but the proof is in the driving and real world evaluations...There are core MB, BMW, Jag, Audi buyers regardless of what the other competition is doing. However, its the swing buyers that can really impact this sector's leadership. Seemed like we do agree tho' that the lswill likely retain its crown in the NA market.Now here's a question for you: Do you seriously believe that the reason the lsis the leader of this pack is bcos it is cheaper ? I seriously would question who is using your ID if anything from Lexus didn't win you over. Hmmmm..... The current Gen 3 LexusLS didn't win me over, that's why I still own the Gen-2. Ditto the LexusES, RX, & SC. Only the '06 GS, '06 IS, LX, and marginally GX (only the swing rear gate is my issue with this truck) are my favorites in the Lexus lineup. Of course, the '07 lsis already a winner in my books. Lexus may NOT win styling, but it more than makes up for it in the total package of its product - pricing, features, and customer care. That is a sign of a great product. If the Germans understand that, they'd be more successful against Lexus, imo. This LS460 is a winner in this market. Packed with all of these features, with a drive that will be dream-like, I am expecting perfection, and I think they will deliver the ride and handling. The rims are 19"", and the suspension will be there to handle all of that powertrain. I drove the IS350 non-sport, and the 3Series  SP, the latter drove marginally better, but I will need an apples-to-apples drive before I can give the crown to the Bimmer. However, the '06 GS300 I drove didn't do it for me. Smooth yes, driveable, no. But the GS350/460 are only a year away, so maybe they'll re-tune these cars for better performance and handling, and maybe a kill switch for VDIM.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                To everyone and their loved ones/families and friends. Isn't it so nice to talk less and listen more ? I am loving my back-seat lurking mode so much, I may make it semi-permanent. BTW, just got the LX470 an '03, and loving it. Now solidly Lexus in my car/truck purchases. Was talking to my dealer last week and he opined that the 2007 LS460 base would not add much to 2006 LexusLS base price. That would be nice. And that the LS600h is projected at $90K-ish base, which would come pretty much loaded. That is beyond my price range, so I am taking a pass. My 110K miles '99 LexusLS is long due for a replacement, and now that Santa (my wife) has gotten her LX, the road is clear for a 2007 lsfor me. However, this time I will possibly expand my lsreplacement search to include the A8 and the 7Series (if the new redo gets here by next year). No MB in my future until they get their act together...

"                To me, MB was always the top of the top (being close to 50 years old).  I did own the first GS300 and while it was incredibly smooth and reliable, I became bored with it quickly.  I am currently driving a BMW 3Series  which is a blast and has been problem free and a great machine.  Now that I am interested in getting back into the luxury category I am having fun testing many cars.The BMW 7Series just didn't do it for me.  It's neither fish nor fowl.  Not luxurious and not sporty.  The Jag XJ is very nice but I'm not sure if it's in the same league.  I may take for an extended drive.  The a8 was very impressive but the back is so long that it really is a limo.  Also, first year model from Audi scares me off a bit.  No doubt that LexusLS is best bang for buck and a no hassle experience, yet it didn't wow me yet.Just trying to justify 70K for the MB vs 60 for lsand have a little nagging thought about reliability of the Benz based on Consumers Reports.

Fewer cars in this price range are leased relative to entry level luxury cars.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Totally correct analysis. BMWs are all about hype and perception. They are a disappointment in terms of substance when compared to Audi and Mercedes-Benz. The 7Series, like mentioned earlier, gets knocked about in the majority of world-wide comparisions when it goes up against the A8L,SClass, the LexusLS, and even the XJ. The 7Series is due for a remake around '09 when the new A8 arrives so that will be interesting. Wonder if there any moles snooping around Inglostadt and Munich? The new SClass wins because of all its gizmos, not necessarily a good thing. MB has to be careful as the SClass is starting to gain an image of ""overdone"" and ""overwraught.""  It's pretentious image will turn into one of crassness as the SClass is beginning to look borish and arrogant (generally a BMW trait).  The previous SClass was more subtle and that made it elegant. Now it seems that MB has gone the way of Munich and has over-engineered and overstyled the car (just look at those fenders). It lacks a certain elegance in person. But the bigger the phalic symbol, the more attention I guess. Not real measure of achievement if that is what you are trying to show the world.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"                True...I live in San Diego... Not a cheap city to live by any stretch. $200K joint income is pretty much middle class here. For a city harboring one of the richest zip codes in America, an  SClass is nothing to shout about. Way too many rich folks in this city of 3 Million. But $200K income, with proper investments can afford lots more than the income suggests. We have been lucky to have moved out of stocks into real estate a tad earlier than many others. And we did good in the red-hot market out here... So if you judge by income you'd say why would I buy an SClass... But I sure can afford to lease one if I want to... However, the LS460 fits the bill for me. Luxury, refinement, style, quality, features/gadgetry (love gadgets) and priced right. I won't overpay for a 3-pointed star, period.Hey, I got this brochure in the mail from Lexus. It claims the LS600hL will be 208.2"" long. That'll put it a few inches LONGER than the SClass. Is that going to be the case ? Oh it also says the output will be MORE than 430HP, with SULEV (70% cleaner emission than an SClass/A8L/760iL)... Imagine this car priced in the mid-80s ? It'd sell out pretty quick. But here is the caveat: Lexus says the car is still in ""development"" but will be out in 2007. Huh !!! I'd hope its closer to production by now...

"                Trying to defeat the so-called ""Lexi group"" is useless.... Same as trying to defeat the ""BMW-crowd"" or ""MB-fanatics"". Stating which: many of us Lexi fans know quite a bit about MBs and BMWs (prior owners, friends and family), but I find that *many* German car fans are more introverted with their brand loyalty and don't even bother to learn much about Toyota/Lexus bcos of the bias based on perceptions of Japanese cars. The most some of them know are culled from auto rag comparos, reviews, comments, whatever.... Those like Merc1 and even (newly minted) Livinbmw use qualifiers such as yawns, boring, ugly, copy-cats, etc to describe Lexus cars and trucks. Interesting to see that these days when we talk about MBs and BMWs its more to do with their styling than their performance. Like Michael_Mattox correctly stated, today's MB is more about style (look-at-me) than function (how-much-I-offer-you). How sad ! The most illustrious, innovative, marque brand on the planet (MB) is more concerned about how their product ""looks"" than what it does !!! As a Lexus owner, I have written my comments on a test drive of my colleagues '03 C230 6-speed Kompressor. I have also test driven an '04 LexusLS, and written my comments about the car. HAd long and extensive test drives of the LexusLS, 528i, GS3, and A6, prior to buying the LexusLS. My wife prefered I purchase the BMW, and I was quite close to buying it but went with my head rather than my heart, and bought the LexusLS. Feel a lot better about that decision. I am only 41, very active, very educated, and a working class professional. Looks like I may not fit the profile of an lsowner (50-ish, business owner-type, non-athletic, yada yada yada). I have many friends who are MB and BMW owners. I have written about some of their experiences with their German cars. Overall, they give their cars mid-grade in reliability and performance. Talking of performance, maybe we need to re-produce an excerpt from the Dec 2003 C&D comparo of the $70K lux cars (which the LexusLS won, remember): The Lexus ride is unmatched in this group. There's a switch on the dash that lets you make it a little worse if you must. Go ahead, if more sinew in the suspenders makes you think handling is better.... Acceleration is brisk: second best to 60 mph; third in the quarter, at 95 mph, as it showed taillights to three of the four Germans...That is the lsthat is ridiculed here as a yawn and a boring car. 0-60 in about 6s is boring to German car fans. Even when it shoes tailights to the likes of the SClass and Audi A8. Boring indeed !!! Yeah right. Turned out the S came LAST in the comparo. That is truly a huge failure especially since many MB fans live and die on these comparos anyway. There is much that was revealed in the Dec 2003 comparo; how truly Lexus has climbed the ladder of success against the Germans, and how truly the Germans have fallen against the despised and much ridiculed (boring yawn) Lexus. Like I always say, MB execs are NOT yawning at Lexus now, are they ? Maybe they'll get their cut-backs from their workers and use these $600M+ to build a better car than Lexus builds. Guess, we'll see won't we.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                U(denali) stopped making sense about 300 posts ago. 1) This whole thing about the value of ""rebadging"" cars makes no sense at all. The reason that Lexus can take a Toyota, and turn it into a class leader in comfort, ride, and reliability is in part because Toyota makes a great car to begin with. Whether or not you think it's ""cool"" or ""sporting"" enough, is purely subjective, and not relevant here. MB can't take a chrysler and turn it into a MB because most chrysler's are crap. Once a pig, always a pig, so don't start talking about how MB doesn't ""rebadge"" cars. Would it make a difference if Toyota made the LexusLS and didn't call it a lexus? Would it no longer be a great luxury vehicle? It would still kick theSClass's butt in all the comparison tests whether it was called a Lexus or Toyota.2) Making 20 different cars (A, C, E, S, G, ML, CL, SL, SLK, Smart) doesn't make you the ""best"" luxury car maker. Nor does making the most expensive car in every segment either, which MB certainly does. Nor does taking a single platform/class and putting 10 different engines into it and marking up the price logarithmically. Jaguar has for years made beautiful and expensive vehicles, but I don't think they qualify as a ""great"" luxury car maker, and their cars aren't top-flight luxury vehicles- overpriced, unreliable, eccentric, cramped, etc. They get crushed in every comparison test published. 3) If you really believe that if your A8 or SClass would somehow be an objectively inferior car if it was a VW or Chrysler then you have been completely blinded by the marketing gurus at Audi and MB. You'd be paying a premium for what? Badges? Tradition? A policy of non-rebadging? What?4) IMHO, the only reason that MB can still sell the SClass is precisely because of people like denaliimpa, who can't see a car for what it is beyond the badge on the hood. And there are plently of people like him, who would gladly pay an extra $15-20K for an, at best, competitive car compared to the LexusLS. It ain't faster, quieter, sportier, more luxurious, reliable, higher tech, etc than the LexusLS, but there are plenty of people who are more than happy to give their money away. Which is fine with me, but don't come back here and start telling intelligent people who can make objective decisions about how the SClass has more tradition and has thicker sheetmetal and that MB doesn't rebadge cars and therefore is a ""better"" luxury car maker and is superior to the LexusLS.To me, what defines a great luxury car maker? A manufacturer (regardless of country of origin, tradition, years in the business, etc) who can make a luxurious, attractive, spacious, safe, w/all the ""bells and whistles"" and supremely reliable vehicle for a competitive price. You want to spend $15-20K more for a similar car by another manufacturer- no problem- but just admit you spent it on prestige, looks, tradition. Not on a ""better"" vehicle made by a ""better"" manufacturer.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Understand your point on pricing and agree with it for the most part. But when you consider your points and all the MB niche car points we've discussed it shows pretty clearly what is wrong with MB's strategy. They are trying to be a volume producer and a boutique high-end car maker at the same time and the two strategies work against each other. Too much volume kills the status icon (over time) and has yielded all these reliability problems. Lower volume with high quality (the MB mantra all the MB enthusiasts wish they would go back to) supports the high pricing and the status icon. So which way do they go? At the 50.000 foot level it's pretty clear to me they can't go both ways. But at the same time can they watch Lexus increase scope and creep deeper into their lineup and niche car territory while at the same time making a ""true"" thrust at Europe? Remember also they have to match and/or stay ahead of their true European nemesis - BMW.  It's a soap opera. Lexus' biggest mistake is trying to take on BMW at the same time as MB? Never made sense. Moving off the initial strategic plan is always a problem no matter who you are. The IS is out of the mainstream and lacks the internal support (marketing dollars, budget support, etc) to make it a success. The GS needs to be addressed as it is the only real weakness in the ""strategic mainstream"" car line-up. The lsand LexusES hit their marks very well and the RX is a runaway success. The SChas varied too much over time for it to establish itself firmly but it sells about the volume they were expecting anyway. Long-terrm though - it's a key branding car for them just like the SClass is for MB. Sellling 45k larger suv's annually at $50-70k is also quite an achievement. Time will tell if the next GS will cut it. You know my initial reaction and I've yet to see the car. But I'd also expect a lot of surprises with the next GS. I do think the next lswill be an absolute smash. I could be wrong but it's also why I think they really have moved the lsproduction date up to 2006. They want it to support the GS and at the same time it does not allow the SClass to have a one year lead time like the last go-round.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Very subtle revisions, which corporate bosses would love since it leverages established identity. Of course, detractors of the current design would not be persuaded by very subtle tweaks - but the big problem with a major revision is that you might alienate an existing customer base that is sold on the existing concept and will stay loyal as long as you don't screw around with the recipe. Just ask BMW... :-)I think the luxury sedan world has 2 schools of thought: the first one is the school of stealth & understatement, to which Mercedes used to belong until the new SClass came out. Interestingly, the previous generation 7Series also competed with Mercedes on conservative ground. Lexus undoubtedly has remained a clear proponent of conservative design. VW's Phaeton clearly follows that school of thought as well. Audi's A8 also does, even if in the non-stretch version it has a somewhat more dynamic look. Then there's the school of ""look at me"", which ranges from merely some more ornate elements to the downright flamboyant. The current generation SClass now looks conservative, but it was regarded as a risque design when it came out. People weren't used to that from MB. BMW of course has gone all the way with the Bangle 7. I'd also say the new Jag XJ is a bit more ornate than the cars in the first group.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Wait a minute...just because some ""marketing"" shows the LexusLS to be bought by older folk than say the A8 or 7Series or even theSClass, on average, such marketing is BS?  How hypocritical is that?  I bet when this same group says that lss have a very high buy-again rate it isn't bs then is it?  Marketing folk, for example track loyalty rates and buyers ages in the same breath, so you can't seperate one ""marketing"" fact from another because you don't like one of them. Lexusguy, Yep I'd agree that the ML is a yawnbox, but so is the  RX , LX470, and every other SUV on the market, except the FX45, Cayenne S & Turbo, Touareg V8, and Range Rover.  I simply can't stand the beast. dieselbreath, Good points about safety, but this isn't the board for them.  Lexi won't grasp any of that unless you can point them to a JDP or CR graph.  You can just about forget bringing up that simulated crash testing is only part of what MB and Volvo have been doing before anyone else, including the government.  Forget that Volvo and Mercedes recover a percentage of their cars right after a serious crash to see how their real world safety can be improved.  None of this will matter here. Thicker sheetmetal was so evident here a few years ago after a hellacious hail storm.  Of all the cars in the lots only the Volvos, Mercedes and VW/Audis weren't damaged.  Everything else including BMWs had all types of little pock marks and what not. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Warren Brown wrote about the 2006 Lexus lsin the Washington Post today.  The whole review was about how he didn't like the way the rear seat felt to sit on (he loves the rear seat in the Lincoln Town Car), and how the lswasn't worth the money since it didn't have a DVD screen in the back and a Honda Odyssey, which costs much less, does.The funny thing is that in the sidebar to the article, he notes ""The LexusLS has excellent acceleration and superior handling. From the driver's seat, the car is an absolute joy, especially when its electronic suspension is set on the ""Sport"" mode.""  But somehow that doesn't matter since his tush didn't like the rear seat and his 11-yr-old godson missed his family's minivan's DVD player.The other brilliant observation was ""Nearly everybody mistook the Lexus LexusLS for an SClass Mercedes-Benz. That may be flattering to Mercedes-Benz, but it does little to establish an independent LexusLS identity.""  Of course, no where in the article did he mention that the next model has already been announced and shown (at least in pre-production form), and it looks nothing like anSClass.One thing I noted is that he drove an Ultra Luxury package which had the ""Euro-tuned Sport Suspension"" - so merc1, other people don't seem to have a problem finding the sport setup that you repeatedly say doesn't exist.In any case,  everybody who rides in the back of my '05 lsloves it.  So unless Lexus did something very weird with the '06 model, I really don't understand what this guy is talking about.So according to Mr. Brown, we're all wrong here: the lsis in fact a great ""driver's car"" with superb handling; it's just a poor ""passenger's car"" filled with technology you can get for less in other (non-luxury) cars.  :confuse: You gotta read this to believe it (free website registration):Wash Post lsreview ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jaguar took very few chances, and even if it does have a styling advantage over the Lexus, people are not so in love with the Jag's styling as to actually buy it over a Lexus or Mercedes. The A8 is an attractive car, but it still has the ""Audi"" shape, just in large size, compared to medium (A6) and small (A4).

"                We're definitely on the same page in reguards to styling of the current S and especially the CL. I personally expect the next S to be what you said, an evolution of the newEClass, but with a slightly different rear end.   I'n not sure if the next car (just going by the spy photos and various drawings) will look as good as the current car, especially the Sport version of the current S.  IMO only the A8 even compares looks wise.  The 7Series continues to be hideous to me. It might be a little too early to speculate about its styling without a definite drawing or an uncamoflouged prototype being caught during testing. I've read where the brake by wire of the E and SClass won't make it into the next S due to cost reasons.  This sounds bass-ackwards to me, simply because the S is much more expensive than  EClass  anyway.  So who knows what they'll do there.   Incredibly ""electromechanical"" brakes are being developed for the S, but not at the initial launch.  Automatic lane correction has (thankfully) been pushed back, due to concerns about all this tech debuting in a totally new car, which will also include (rarely for MB) an all need engine range also.  So far everything says that Mercedes will adopt some type of idrive controller combined with the next generation of Comand.   The controller will reportedly give the driver a choice between using the conventional buttons or not.   From what the British press says, the controller won't take the place of basic controls like in the BMW.   I must say that the spy photograph presented by autospies looks just like the 7Series BMW, right down to the air vents and gearshift, scary.  I for one can't believe Mercedes would copy the styling of the 7Series interior, that would be an unprecedented move (read: mistake) on Mercedes' part.  We should know more this summer when they'll have to start testing more and more prototypes out in the open in anticipation for next year's debut. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                We're only 3 full months into the New Year, and no all companies are not in the same situation.  Some have newer models, so have older models.  Some are going through model change over in the spring as opposed to the fall.   Some have new products in the hottest segments of the market.  Staggered model introductions etc. etc.  There a jillion reasons why sales could be off for any particular brand as a whole at any given point in the year.  This is why I look to look at the individual models to see who is doing what.  Give the spring buying season a few months to lead into summer and then count the totals.   VW is the only brand that anyone has mentioned here that has had a continuous drop from year to year, not MB, BMW or Audi.  If I were VW I'd be worried, and they've clearly said as much.  Their sales have been in a free-fall for over a year, not the others!   Every one of VW's affordable cars date back to either 1998 or 1999.  No other brand is even remotely in the same situation, which is their fault.   The Phaeton and Touareg are new, but cost a lot of money for VWs.  Complete uphill battle there for VW, especially with the Phaeton, which will never be a big seller. Another factor is suvs.  Lexus and Cadillac, to their credit cash in big time here.  Almost fifty percent of Lexus' business is SUVs.   Cadillac just added a crossover to their product mix, the SRX.  Nothing but pay dirt to be had there.  Also like Lexus they have a hot 30-40K car, the CTS.  The current Seville isn't even on the same page with  EClass  in sales.  They dropped the STS version of the current Seville in preparation for the new STS this fall.   See how that could affect sales for the whole brand if they didn't have the SRX/Escalade to prop the brand up???I'm not trying to say that SUV sales aren't significant, just illustrating a point as to why certain brands are grabbing the sales headlines right now.   Just think what the sales numbers for Lexus would be without the  RX  and GX470 and Cadillac without the Escalade and SRX. My point is the Europeans are traditionally weak in the SUV market (which is their fault) and they tend to have model lineups that are thicker at the top end of the price spectrum.   Mercedes-Benz in particular when you look at their model/price spread, frankly has no place in a sales race to begin with.  I was shocked when the broke 200K units a year. The C-Class (their biggest seller) was way down last month and will probably sink even further once this month's totals are counted.  The 2005 model doesn't go on sale until mid-May.  The SClass came to market in spring of 1999 as a 2000 model and was face lifted for the 2003 model year.  The next SClass is due to come here in the spring of 2006 as a 2007 model.  This is also the oldest car in its class yet is only second to the LexusLS in sales.  That doesn't say anything?   Before spring of 2006, which is a long time from now, of course the car will fade away sales wise, this is only natural.  The LexusLS is on a similar time table and will cool down after this year also. No I'm not worried in the least about Cadillac gaining on Mercedes in sales.  Still doesn't prove who makes a better car nor is the sales race equal for all brands.  When Cadillac can sell more then 300 XLRs a month I'll take them seriously.   10K cars is not a lot of ground to make for a brand with a much cheaper lineup of cars overall.  BMW has three new models for 2004.  Only the new 5Series was available from the start of year.  I was never sure why you mentioned the 7Series as being the problem when the car is in it's third model year and is hardly news anymore, a decline here is inevitable.  You do realize their new X3 and 6-Series models only went on sale in mid-March?  How could you possibly base that theory about BMW's redos not making a difference when 2 of their three new models for 2004 weren't even on sale in Jan-Feb????  Another reason why I say all this hysteria over the first three months is unfounded.   Wanna bet the 645Ci Convertible has not hit its stride yet?   I'll eat my shoes if BMW doesn't increase their overall sales this year compared to last year!  I think if you truly did factor in everything you wouldn't have made nearly as much fuss about any of this, especially based on a mere 3 months worth of sales numbers. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Well actually that is the wrong S.  The current LexusLS is a throwback in design to the 1992-1999 SClass the W140, not the current W220.  You know the W140, big slab-sided one.   The LexusLS isn't a copy of the currentSClass.  The current SClass is still miles ahead of the current S in looks though, there is no comparison.  Pics don't show it, especially with both of their behinds.     One is upright and square (LS) and the other smooth and sleek.   M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                We'll just have to agree to disagree on the lsand the SClass being so similar.  I see one desirable car and one as an imitation of a previous design.  As far as their driving goes, I'm not making either out to be a sports sedan, only that they aren't as similar as you say they are.  If they were, there would be no market for theSClass.  You're really surprising me with the theory that a waiting lists is a bad thing.  Now if I go to the lstopic I can find ""The first 2 months worth are sold out"".  What is that?   Saying that a waiting list is a bad thing is sheer resentment over the fact that Lexus doesn't have one.  Lexus wishes the SC430 had a following like the SL.   BTW, the ES300, LexusLS all had slight ""waiting lists"" when they were first introduced no?  I'm sure the  RX  has one now too.  People that want a car like a SL, SC430, Ferrari, or even a 350Z  don't go anywhere in a month or so, if that were the case these car's sales would fall flat 6 months after their introduction.   People have been waiting since the mid-nineties for a new SL, ditto for a new coupe from Lexus, as both of their predecessors rans for years and years.  So when a new one comes out all these people who've been wanting for a new SCor SClass for years are going to walk because they have to wait a few more months.  I know you don't really believe that.    It's not like this group needs a car per say either.    A waiting list is the best thing any carmaker can have in todays market.  It means you have a hot product.   BTW, good design last as the previous SClass had its best sales year well into it's production run, like around it's 6th or 7th model year.  Though Lexus will never attain that, their previous SC430 was a highly reguarded car that many Lex fans were anxiously awaiting it's replacement.  They aren't going to walk away from purchasing a SC430 because of a waiting list, because of it's design compared to the old car possibly, but not because of a waiting list. syswei, I'm not blindly trusting a survey like you're doing.  You think they're the end-all for car ownership and they aren't.  You missed the point about the Acura and Lexus transmission problems.   When Benz owners come in here and post about a problem its seen as an epidemic, but when an Acura TL or Lexus LexusES owner says something about a transmission failure it's not even mentioned.   There is also a need for a clear definition as to what exactly qualifies as a repair as a opposed to maintanence.  How you can you put so much faith in something and you don't even know the criteria they use (JDP)?   It doesn't make sense. Also on the trans problem.  Your thinking doesn't even allow for the possibility that not everyone who had a trans failure got a survey in the first place.  There are millions of cars sold here every year and you're drawing a conclusion based on 50,000 of them, spread out among more than a few brands.  No where did I state that the survey wouldn't ask about the engine/transmission, i.e. drivetrain of the car.  Why twist what I stated?  I said that if the problems were as widespread as they seem, by reading this board, then Acura and Lexus should have been affected more because (per you) these surveys are always correct and flawless. I think I already agreed with you that designo editions were not worth the money, so you're repeating it for....? You Lexus guys are really going to have to get a better grasp on all this data you all love to post about.   ""Days supply""...traditionally meant how many cars are in the U.S. sales pipeline, not how many cars are on the dealer's lots.  Do you really think all, or even the smallest fraction of the 300+ Mercedes dealers in the U.S. have 12+ days supply of SLs on their lots?  Thats about as far fetched as thinking one dealer has 35 SLs in stock.  The old standard of ""days supply"" means that under normal conditions they'll sell all the SLs in both ports (Jersey, Cali) in 12 days.   If you can find more than 2 or 3 A8s on any Audi dealers lot you get a gold Audi ring set.  JDP really needs to stop it with these bs factoids. Anyone who knows anything about cars could tell you that their list of cars/suvs/vans are all the ""hot"" ones right now.  Any one of these brands aren't going to have many if any of these models in stock, especially the luxury cars. ______I'm hesitant to join in on the demographics debate again, but I think overall it's the type of car (i.e. price, size, luxury first or sport first, or a good mix of, etc) that dictates the ""demographic"" as to who will be looking at it.  Secondly it would be the brand and it's heritage, name recognition etc.   In either case it's probably less than 5 years that seperate the lsand S from each other, as both are older than the guys looking at 7Series BMWs. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Well I agree with you on almost everything. Wow, except for the BMW part. I like BMW's and wouldn't mind getting one, but there are a few things I don't like about them, especially the styling. Mercedes seem snazzier and seem to stand out more than the BMW's, but it is just my opinion.(And I am getting sick of seeing them, every one seems to have one, friends family neighbors, they are everywhere! And they all have the same look.) And I like the performance of my Benz and the interior seems a bit nicer than the BMW. And the only reason why I mention Lexus' performance is because that has been my point all along, but people jumped all over me when I mentioned it. It seemed like people were denying it I never denied that Lexus makes fine reliable cars. And I am not surprised why they are so popular.And I am not surprised by the 60 times, (I looked them up when people jumped all over the S) again I never really looked or studied the lsand for the S I would look at them at the car dealer when I was there or read about them once in a while but never studied them or the competition seriously because I haven't considered buying one. I do have an uncle who has one but never drove it myself and none of my friends own an S.  I do admire the S for what it is,and it is Mercedes flagship car. I have never really paid too much attention to the LexusLS, It has never been my cup of tea, they have never excited me, but I do have a new found respect for the lsnow, but both cars are not my kind of cars and I don't want to own either. But both are fine autos and I can see why people who own them are proud of them.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Well don't get me wrong on the Pacifica, its a fine vehicle, it just isn't a Lexus and the price difference shows that.  I'd still go for it, its more family friendly than the 300. ""All OAC is saying - he can correct me if I am wrong - is he doesn't consider sub $25-30K cars as real lux car sales. Neither do I. But MB and BMW will always count them - as would anyone if they are in their position - for obvious reasons. So saying a million cars is sold by either brand is fine but don't misrepresent fleet taxis and $18-25K cars with real low profit margins as real luxury car sales because they are not and Government data supports that.I have to ask you when was the last time you looked at a 325i or C230, neither of which you'll find on a dealer lot in base form and neither are that close to 25K for this to be a valid point.  My second point is that both entry level cars from BMW, MB and even Audi trade on being sports sedans and they are hardly the strippers you're implying.  Look at their pricing.  As far as 18-25K cars in Europe, again you really need to check the pricing of these vehicles.  BMW and Mercedes still sell cars that cost more than any Lexus and they do it handidly, especially Mercedes.  Even if you take out all the cars below your price point of 18K, you'd find that BMW and Mercedes still crush Lexus worldwide by far.  I will never, ever agree that MB or BMW are not luxury brands when they still sell more luxury priced cars (30k+) than Lexus does worldwide.  Mercedes in particular has a market penetration that Lexus can only dream of at this point. BTW, that Government price stuff was a lame excuse to give Cadillac the luxury sales title and more importantly to set the bar for that silly luxury tax way back when.  The U.S. Governement hasn't a clue of what a real luxury car is because the home brands don't even compete at the premium level.  It also think its a little early to claim where Lexus' prices will start when they too will offer a 4-banger diesel in Europe.  Hardly a ""luxury"" car either by Oac's standard. Is Toyota seperate from Lexus or are you joining that bandwagon too, by saying Toyota in one market and Lexus in another?  If the 325i isnt' a luxury car, then neither is the IS300.  This 30K price barrier is ridiculous if you're going to use that as your sole criteria as to what a luxury car is.  A luxury car is price, specification, engineering, refinement, performance and other things besides just what it cost.  For one car not be a luxury car at 29K and the other is at 32K is just too ridiculous to me.   You have to look at the cars themselves and every aspect of them otherwise the Honda Accord Hybrid is a luxury car at 30K+, and we all know it isn't.  A BMW or Mercedes, regardless of their price provide the same trademarks: experience/styling/engineering/safey as the upper models, just not in as great a quantity. How can you knock MB and BMW as not being luxury brands when Lexus is the ultimate in branding 101.  It was created soley for the purpose of getting people to pay more for Toyota made products.  If Mercedes and BMW sell some non luxury cars by your definition, then some of these re-worked Toyotas that are branded as Lexuses are just as suspect to me, especially the current IS300 (a Euro Toyota), ES330 and  RX .  Now because Lexus has convinced Americans to pay more than 30K for them makes luxury cars, while a low-brow BMW/MB thats provides all the characteristics true to their respective brand aren't because they start at less than 30K?  That is a clear double standard.  Europe is a different story I'll give you, but even there I'd like to see some numbers for all these low end 1Series, A-Class and 5Series/E-Class cars that are sold with nothing on them but the basics, I bet without all these Lexus still doesen't even get close, especially in Europe.  There is no way a half-million MBs and BMWs are even close to being all strippers, compared to 25K Lexuses sold in Europe last year.  No way. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Well I went over there and I couldn't find much of what you are talking about. One guy - legendman - seems to have a lemon and another guy doesn't think the ML stereo is worth it. I disagree about as much as it is possible to disagree with the latter person. Maybe in an RX it doesn't sound so good (I've never heard it in the RX) but in the GS, lsand LX it is awesome. As for the first guy he may have a bad car. I've driven the RX300 and  RX  at least 30-35 times since 1995. I always take it as a loaner. The 330 is a far superior vehicle to the 300 with a more luxurious cabin and ride and it is a lot quieter than the 300.  The 330 (and the 300 beforehand) are both cars to me that have some height and AWD. This guy finds the opposite to be true and doesn't think its carlike at all plus he thinks its noisy. What Lexus is?? He owns it, I don't. But alas this is as popular vehicle as there is in my town and I don't know anyone who feels the way legendman does and my personal experience behind the wheel of the RX is as far removed from his as it gets. You'll hate hearing this but everyone I know loves this car and I got deals on one  for five of these people over the years.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Well I saw that post about production capacity, but I decided not to post on it because it was just more of the same, and I found the GS430/5Series argument more interesting.  Yes,  that really is interesting that the most efficient car company in the world is suddenly held up by production capacity all of sudden this year.   Yet on any give day you'll get a sermon about Toyota's amazing production capacity, ability and techniques.   Yet the drop in sales of the LexusLS, IS and LexusES is capacity problem?    Don't bring up the larger, way more powerful Avalon because it isn't a ""Lexus"" and doesn't provide the same experience as the LexusES according to the logic present here.  I mentioned that the Avalon really puts the ES330 in the shade and got complete silence, well except for the better dealer service angle.   We all know the ES330 is itself just an upgraded Camry as the Avalon is.  Problem is that the new 280hp Avi has been upgraded to such a status that it really doesn't make sense to buy an ES330, imo.   Now watch dealer service get mentioned, because Avi provides the same isolated/nav/stereo/leather experience that the LexusES does plus its much bigger and faster.  I mean you never see anything mentioned about actual driving from the Lexus camp as its always those things. That is the Lexus experience.  So why a similar Toyota isn't capable of delivering the same experience is beyond me and in the case of the new Avi its clearly more car for the same or less money than the LexusES.     It even looks like a Lexus to me, both it and the LexusES are battling for the worst looking sedan crown. Lastly, on a different note I thought you were a big Lexus fan unless I'm getting your handle confused with someone else??M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Well I'm back.  I see I haven't missed anything, but 325+ posts about the same stuff we've been arguing about for years now it seems!!  I may or may not go back through all of those posts to respond to some of the more curious items.  Anyway, down to business. This year's NAIAS was without a doubt the best I've ever been too.  The sheer number of new cars and stunning concepts took two days to fully absorb.  All of the hard times we read about are all forgotten for a few hours by buyers and executives alike it seems.  It also shows that when some in the automotive industry are in trouble the creative thinking (or survival skills) kicks into high gear.  Since this is the luxury board I'll mainly discuss the luxury car scene at Detroit this year. Audi - Audi is, for the first time feeling themselves in the U.S. Their model line brochures now read ""Arguably The Best Cars in the World"".  Looking at the S8,S6,RS4, and Q7 you get the feeling that you could seriously entertain that notion.  The S8 is absolutely stunning, inside and out.  The B&O sound system arrives this fall for 8K!  The S8 on display didn't have the system (come on Audi, why not?).  The RS4 is an A4 on something powerful.  The S6 is just a smaller S8 with a little less power.  There was also an A8 W12 there with a 26K(!) interior package from Quattro GmBh.  Stunning, but not worth that kind of money, the whole car stickered for over 150K!  Despite all the performance vehicles on display, the real important intro for Audi is the Q7.  It has the typical Audi high-quality, high-style interior, and it is a looker.  There will be a 3.6L V6 model sometime this summer, same engine as the Passat 3.6 (276hp).  I predict success for this vehicle for sure.  Audi's future is as bright as it can be IMO. They're pouring on the performance this year to better compete with that other performance minded German luxury brand. There isn't an unattractive or loser car in their lineup. Cadillac - Very impressed with the STS-V overall, but like so many GM products the interior isn't up to the price and the XLR-V at 100K is just wishful thinking.  There is no way the car is worth that.  The good news and all the crowd yowling took place at the Escalade stand.  There they were the Escalade, Escalade EXT and Escalade ESV, all in black.  I've always liked the EXT version (the one with the pickup bed).  The only fly in the buttermilk is that the interior plastics look great as does the interior design, but if the Chevy Tahoe and GMC Yukon are anything to go by, the plastics are still of the hard and cheap variety.  The CTS seemed incredibly dated.  Just looking around the Cadillac display I get the feeling something is missing, a true flagship vehicle to compete in the big leagues is needed. Mercedes-Benz - Two SClass models on display, a  SClass and S65 AMG.  The SClass fender arches don't appear as big in real life as the do in photos.  Now the SClass with the AMG wear like the S65 had is stunning and very aggressive looking.  The basic S without the AMG kit looked a lot better than I originally pictured it. The car is huge, but still very sleek and hides its bulk extremely well.  This is no 1992 SClass by any means when it comes to looking bulky.  Interest was very high for the S, GL, SLR (of course), SClass and CLS.  There was a black CLS55 AMG tucked in the corner of the display.  This particular one had the AMG Performance Package.  Absolutely stunning!  This car had people standing around with their mouths open as did the SLR.  I happen to walk up at the right time because I got a chance to sit in the previously locked SL55. With all the hoopla about the SClass and CLS, I had forgotten about how much I love the SL.  The car fells custom made.  Separate from Detroit, the SClass facelift details have been revealed. See Article.  They had two samples of the new GL there.  The GL looks a lot more distinctively Benzish in person. There is even a hint of the real ""G"" there too, the real G (a G55) was also on display.  However, the GL's interior isn't going to hold a candle to the Range Rovers I saw. No chance.  MB had better not go looking for a direct confrontation on price with Land Rover on this one.  Apart from having a merely ""nice"" interior as opposed to s stunning one, the GL is larger than it looks in pictures.  The third row could actually be used by smaller humans.  No CL on display, guess it is farewell to my favorite Benz design from 2000-2005, the new model will be shown in March at Geneva.  The diesels start arriving this fall.  First the E320, then the ML320 and R320 and then a GL320 next spring.  The C-Class is showing its age for sure and  EClass  (while mobbed) is showing some age also.  The biggest problem I saw here is that the interiors of the ML,R and the GL to a lesser degree aren't up Benz's car interiors.  This is done on the instance of MBUSI still trying to save a buck.  All three have ""nice"" interiors that would pass muster in lesser-named vehicles, but not in a Mercedes when the S,CLS,SL,CLK are sitting right there nearly feeling and looking like they're built by someone else.  Overall, Mercedes-Benz still draws a huge crowd and all the oohs and ahhs.  Crisis?  What crisis? BMW - I'll take an M6 please.  Very impressive in that it can ""clobber"" Aston-Martins (as the BMW rep advised). This was my first time really seeing the 2006 7Series up close.  I'd only seen it on the road and/or just driving by the dealership.  It looks a lot better, but it still doesn't cut it for me in the style department.  I will say that the white 760Li on display had a back seat of supreme comfort.  Very bold and brash, but not pretty.  The M3 continues to be a favorite as does the 650i Convertible.  I gave up on trying to sit in the M5, too many people and I'd already sat in the M6 long enough to get on the nerves of some folks waiting to sit in it.  The BMW Coupe Concept is a peculiar item, though it looks worlds better than the previous Z3 Coupe.  I've always liked the Z4, and now the M Roadster slots in for duty.  Should be a real thrill ride with a 330hp version of the M3's I6.  It is still MB,Audi, and BMW for me, but BMW is gaining ground and isn't so distant to Audi anymore. Porsche - The 997 is timeless. I particularly like the C4 versions with their wider bodywork.  Combine that bodywork with a Cabrio top and you have the best looking 911 in years.  Of course the important introduction was the Cayman.  Nice, but I want a 911.  The Cayenne Turbo S is going to be a short lived model because the Cayenne is due for a facelift for 2007, to be shown at Geneva in March and on sale here this fall.  Why they didn't wait until then is a mystery. cont.....            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"                Well I'm not surprised that you don't like the new design.  I'm not too big on it myself, but part of that is because I don't take car design changes too well, especially when the outgoing car was such a good looking design.  I'll need to see the car in person before I can make a final judgement.  I didn't like the CLS either until I saw it so there is still hope with me. The reception to the new SClass has been far warmer on other boards, but everyone is up in arms over those wheel arches, which to me are the only exterior flaw, or at least until I actually see the car.   The interior quality looks to be on the level of Audi/VW, again this based only on looking at it.  That lssketch - that honestly looks good to you?  To me, again imo, looks like a Japanese Cadillac/Lincoln and is like totally forgettable like the 1995 LexusLS.  I think its far to early to base anything on such a sketch though.

"                Well I've always stated that MB is my favorite brand, but not my favorite car in every segment.  If I were shopping in your class there would be only MB and Audi on my list, but in the 30-35K segment there are at least a dozen good or great cars competing and Mercedes' C-Class doesn't really wow me like say an E, SClass or CL does.    I'm looking at the G35 Coupe as the best alternative to any of the German cars in the price range.  I seriously thought about the Acura TL, but couldn't stand the styling, otherwise that would be the car for me.  Me no want a 3Series.  Everyone has one and a new model is due for 2006.  The Saab 9-3 Aero is interesting, but seems to have gone up in price since I last looked at them; it stands at 38K per a walk-around on the local Saab lot earlier this evening.  Too much money and I'm thinking GM DNA is present.  No thanks.  Audi's A4 is another possible choice, but only the 3.0L model, the 1.8t model is a slug.  I'm thinking Audi, MB or Infiniti, the latter two I'm waiting to see their facelifts (G35, C-Class). If passion is overstated hype (NOT!) then these reliability and now sales sermons are just the same.  As far as ""everyday"" people not knowing about Wards, what does that prove?  I wouldn't expect them too because this is the same lot that will read a CR and JDP report and take it as gospel and never think past it, and for a many of these everyday people that works.  They're happy with their boring appliance-like cars.  Just because more people know about Newsweek and Times doesn't mean these two are automobile savvy or some type of automotive authority. oac, I see you've decided to ignore the obvious facts because they don't support any of the current rhetoric.  When shown the sales figures to dispute the notion of the 7 and 5Series being ""tank jobs"" you skip the subject.  This is what is called unsubstantiated hype. ""Two new designs and sales are down?"" Sales are down compared to what??  Is it that you don't want to see the sales chart or don't understand it?   The 5Series is UP YTD over the previous car.  You couldn't be more wrong about the 5Series.  The 7Series is in its 3rd model year and it is only off by 707 cars YTD compared to last year.   What car doesn't have a sales drop in its third model year?  The SC430 has done the same, yet....    You're (hyping) stating that the 7Series sales drop is a crisis, yet the SC430 has done the same in its 4th model year, but that isn't a crisis?  No it isn't, even I wouldn't call it that.  What is happening is natural and it happens with every car sold except for cars like Ferrari etc.  If you really want to see a sales drop watch the GS as it gets eaten alive by  EClass , 5Series, RL, M35/45, A6 and STS, which all are either on sale or go on sale before the new GS does in....gasp...a year from now.   Timing is everything; someone might want to let Lexus know this. ""Merc1 touts MB's higher prices as an excuse why MB sales should not be an issue. I point out that MB sales in the US are down at a time when there are far more affluent buyers than ever before. In California today, 1-in-500 earns $1M or higher per year. That is a huge market for so-called marque brands like MBs. So why is MB sales in decline despite the apparent higher purchasing power of more affluent buyers ?"" So what?  California is but one state and can't carry the entire sales mantle for Mercedes-Benz or any other brand.  It is also foolish to think that just because there are more people with money that they're going to want to show off this wealth by purchasing more Mercedes-Benzes. A totally new product is the only thing that will keep sales for MB or any other company at their same level as a year ago, especially when the previous year was a record year.  Why am I even replying to something so ridiculous?  Secondly, their biggest seller the C-Class is going through a model changeover.  I don't know why this is so hard to grasp.    Yet MB remains in either 3rd or 4th place in the sales race despite having the highest priced cars of any mainstream luxury brand.   Yeah what a failure they are because they aren't able to sell as many tarted up Camrys or tall wagon thingies that sell in the 30-40K range, yet most of MB's products are priced at 50K or above.  Yet Mercedes-Benz is supposed to win the sales race.   I don't think I've read anything so far off in left field on this board in quite a while. Since you're sales theorems are nothing but hot air you'll turn to the MB's corporate situation. Guess what, I don't like it either, but it really has nothing to do with their sales performance so far this year. ""GS, SCand IS sales are not where Lexus would like. The GS has had no redo in years, the SCstill sells pretty well, and the IS was not appropriately positioned in the market. Lexus is addressing both the GS and IS. Now, we'll have to see what happens if the coming redos of these two models will effect sales and improve Lexus' bottomline. I predict that BOTH will be successful, at least much better than the market perception for the new  BMW redos of the 7 and 5 brands."" Excuses, excuses.  The GS has been a failure since the first model back in 1993 it has never sold up to expectations.  Yet the failure of a 7Series you keep incorrectly talking about debuted in 2002 and beat the previous 7Series' best year!  FACT.   The IS was half-baked and everyone knows it.  The SC430 blew right past Lexus' sales estimates for its first year quite easily yet in it's 4th model year has slowed down.  This is the same thing as the 7Series. The same exact scenario, yet BMW is in trouble and Lexus isn't.  This isn't a crisis to most people here, but a natural thing that happens over time, but if you're making a case against BMW you'll play this up as a crisis, though other cars are in the same exact situation. ?I notice you use the words  ""market perception"", when talking about the 5 and 7Series, yet the cars are selling, so this perception you have isn't based on anything factual.  The press has harped about BMW's new styling and idrive, yet just like you guys tell me when a Lexus takes a beating in the press or comparo....the press doesn't buy the cars and they don't have to live with them.....so what they say doesn't count.  Yet here for the sake of building a shaky case (at best) about BMW, market perception makes the 5 and 7Series failure yet they've outsold the previous designs.  WOW.  A contradiction at each and every turn in the Lexusworld.   Double standard hype at its best. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Well in all fairness it appears that the press introduction didn't include any LS460s with the sportier suspension setup.  There is another review, just posted on the British site Autocar.  See article. A few quotes:At its core, the new 375bhp, 4.6-litre V8 provides excellent performance (0-62mph in 5.7sec) but needs to be worked hard to deliver it. That strongly suggests that it actually needs its eight gears rather the transmission being a thinly veiled two-finger salute to Mercedes-Benz with its paltry seven-speed gearbox.I asked one of the Lexus fans long time ago what the advantage was to having a V8 in a luxury car that needs to be revved (to a sports car like RPM) in order to get the torque/power to move the car, but never got an answer.  Simply put a larger engine that makes better low-end torque doesn't need to work as hard.  To Lexus' credit though I'm sure there isn't an ounce of harshness, but the reviewer hints that 8 gears are needed because of the high-rev nature of the V8. Their verdict:Should I buy one?However impressive the LS460 is on paper, in real life it&#146;s a hard car to love, even though you cannot help but admire it. Technological overload is all very well but not when it&#146;s achieved at the expense of that sense of occasion so critical to all true luxury cars.For all its undoubted abilities, it still feels like the world&#146;s most grown-up Toyota. Its cabin functions effectively, but it is not the home from home customers increasingly expect from cars in this class and enjoy every time they step behind the wheel of most European rivals in general, and the Audi A8 in particular.Technocrats will doubtless love it, but for the rest of us, the LS460 suffers from the same fundamental problem as both its predecessors: objectively it does everything you could ask of it, subjectively it falls a little short.M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Well lets just say I disagree with that, the A8 interior actually doesn't look anything like the ls's.   The Audi has a much lower center console and some real designer touches to it, the ls's (imo) interior is just a Avalon x3, lots quality, but not much style, especially with that gaping whole for the Nav screen.   The SLR looks like a Vette???   Sigh. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Well like the SClass last year, the lshas just received a face-lift so it will be hot this year.  The 7Series is up next, for 2005.  Meanwhile 2004 will be a tough year for the 7Series.  I'm personally waiting to see what the A8 can do in a full year.  Actually 2005 might be the A8's ""year"" because they'll be a cheaper swb model, and the W12 model both coming at the end of this year.  I'm also curious to see how many Phaetons VW can move in a full year.  ljflx, Ask some of your Mercedes owning/driving friends why they drive a Mercedes, or what the lure/draw is concerning the actual driving of their cars.  Just a suggestion. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Well I'll tell you, the Q45 is a confused car.   Is it a sports sedan or a full on luxury crusier?  They marketed it as a sports sedan, of which it isn't.  The only truly ""sporty"" sedans of that size are the S55, 7Series (w/Sport package), S8 and XJR, and it doesn't come close to beating any of those cars.   Now since it's priced similar to a 540i does it compete with it?   Not even.  To confuse matters more the M45 is here now and it's being marketed as s sports sedan.  The Q45 is a left out of today's market, mainly by Infiniti's botched marketing of the car.  It should have played the role as a luxury car first, sporty car second.  It doesn't match the luxury of a SClass or LexusLS, and isn't as sporty as say the 7Series...so it's just like forgotten by most buyers.  The car itself is very good on the inside, but it's styling it unbalanced in my eyes.  Way too much front and rear overhangs for me.   The SClass is the only car that manages to pull that off gracefully, especially in the rear. For the first time I think I'm truly head-over-wheels for a Jaguar, this new XJ.  What a car.  Best of all it's very technical and functional, thus being able to truly compete with the usual German and Japanese cars by offering just more than styling/wood/leather.  Job well done.  Now bring back the XJ12!   No doubt about it for me, if there was noSClass, the A8 would be next in line. ljflx, I'm curious to know if you know anyone with a Maybach yet?   Yes the styling isn't the car's strongest suit, I feared that since day one.   I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on the SC430, it's just a 2-door sedan by all account, it doesn't enough driving excitement for for 2-door car posing as a GT car.  I should never, ever see or hear the word Buick when talking about a GT car.    If I were you I'd try at least one German car for 2004, either the A8,  SClass (try a sport or 4Matic model) or SL500 and keep two Lexuses.   The A8 C&D tested was suffering from a glitch, so I'd wait to see what others say before writing it off after one roadtest. Enjoy your vacation! M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Well one way to check is using Edmunds prices. These may vary by zip but heres a look at the resale of 2002's before you add in any options in my area, so it is simply base car to base car.BMW 745 LI values:http://www.edmunds.com/used/2002/bmw/7series/100070588/options.html?tid=edmunds.u.prices.u- - - - - - tmv.vdpprice.13.BMW*I believe MSRP was about $76000 so that means a retained value of 52.9% on trade-in, 56.4% on private sale and 62.3% on dealer sale.LS430 values:http://www.edmunds.com/used/2002/lexus/ls430/100003418/options.html?tid=edmunds.u.prices.u- - - - - - tmv.vdpprice.13.Lexus*MSRP for base car is about $56,000 so that translates to 54.8% on trade-in, 61.1% on private sale and 67.7% on dealer sale.

Ouch! One has to wonder what a Phaeton will retain if this is what an Audi A8 scores. Maybe it will be better.The consumer ratings are also interesting:LS430  9.4 (45 reviews)A8        9.3 (7 reviews)7Series 8.5 (86 reviews)S-class 7.7 (47 reviews)That base SClass that listed for $19K more than an LexusLS in 2002 has seen $18,400 of it go away on a trade-in. This is why the Germans (particularly MB and Audi) are going to have such a hard time holding up the new MSRP's. BMW and Lexus are reasonably close but reliability plays a bigger and bigger role in retained values. How else do you explain Lexus running away from the pack.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Well put.Mine is a 2 Lexus family.  I don't care for their design work either, and chose Lexus for other reasons.  The only Lexus I have admired (at the time), exterior-design-wise, was the old GS300 (well maybe the new  RX  too, but I haven't seen it in person yet).  The old GS was Giugiaro-designed, so I absolutely agree that they should hire Italian designers again!But to say that every Lexus model is a copy of an MB or other design, as Merc1 does, is just not based in fact.  You are right to point out Merc1's flawed reasoning as regards the S vs. LexusLS.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                well said oac. The ls460 now needs to evolve into a true premium HELM and price should be a head to head with 7 and A8.  And it will still have a 14,000$ price advantage over SClass.  It will still be ""GREAT"" value since the quality and reliability and resale value will be higher than 7 and A8.  The driving dynamics will greatly improve too.  May be (just a guess) as good as 7.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"                Well said...When the anti-Lexus crowd started to bad mouth the new LS460 I knew they were scared. The Bangled 7 flopped big (redo after only 2 yrs), no one cares much about the A8 here in NA (pitiful for such a nice looking car), Jag is in free fall (perception trumping reality), and only the SClass is left to compete against Lexus. In comparing against theSClass, we will leave out the S450 cos Lexus has shown they are going after the 550 with the 380/370 combo powerplant in the LS460.MB/AMG, with all their prowress in engine refinement and tuning, could only muster 382HP out of a 5.5L powerplant. Lexus did that with a 4.6L motor. Advantage Lexus.The new  SClass has a 1500-song capacity disk. The new LS460 has 4,000-capacity song. Advantage LexusThe new  SClass tops out at 7000rpm, the new LS460 tops out at 8000rpm. Advantage Lexus.The new  SClass has a 7-speed cog, the new LS460 has an 8-speed. Advantage LexusAuto park in the LS460. None on the SClass. Advantage LexusGet the point.... And this is before release. Lexus is deliberately withholding info until March, a month before the S goes on sale, so that MB cannot scoop them, and so they can take the thunder out of the S release. What a juggernaut Lexus is going to be against the Germans. And 12 months later, MY2008, comes the LS600h with like 470hp/500Ibft, and a fuel economy of a V6. LWB, hybrid, AWD, the features list will be long indeed... Priced in the $90K range. What a car that will be... Little wonder German car fans are so upset and frantic in their search for dissing the LS460. The car is a beauty, and is primed for success. I am sold... I will put my $$$ where my mouth is.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Well thats what I basically meant, they're pricing the Phaeton below its main rival from Germany, not the actual dollar amount.  Nobody can sell a car like a Phaeton or lsfor 35K anymore, but for 76K pretty loaded/awd the Phaeton undercuts VW's main rival the SClass by a huge amount.  I know the numbers aren't the same  when Lexus was willing to take a loss those first few years, VW isn't (and probably can't) do that. In your other post you say that a Mercedes ""lover"" originally stated that a Lexus is a poor mans Mercedes.  It's no rumor, nor does it matter who stated it, it's said because Lexus keeps making their flagship (best premier etc) car in the shadow of Mercedes'SClass, hence the distinction.  It will be denied by some until the end of time, but the LS' whole reason for being is theSClass.  No other cars in this class look alike and pattern themselves after each other like the lsdoes theSClass.  Lexus and only Lexus keeps imitating their nearest competitor in just about every way.  BMW, Jaguar, Audi and now VW all have cars in this class, but they're very different from one another. I know you (a LSx2 owner) and your circle can afford a SClass with no sweat, but the *average* LexusLS buyer can't, especially if someone is paying cash.  Doesn't the average lssell for about 60-63k?  The SClass is double that.   Nothing is etched in stone here, I'm just speaking in general.  The ""poor man's Mercedes"" saying probably came up too when looking at the price spread between the two cars, one starts at 55K and goes to 72K, the other starts at 73K and goes to 125K, thats a huge difference.

"                Well there probably won't be another S8 next year.  The regular ""A8"" will debut first with the ""S8"" being a year or two down the line.  The LexusLS will NOT be redesigned for 2003.  I think what's being confused here is the difference between a facelift and a redesign.  The LexusLS may get a facelift for 2003, more power, equipment, new front and rear ends, but no car of this class (or cars period) gets a total redesign in just 2 years, thats way too expensive even for Toyota. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Well this segment definitely has a new leader.  Not the S, A8 or lswill be able to top this car.  The only questions will be the acceptance of the I-drive concept and the styling. The styling of which I *kinda* like.  The interior will be a knock-out as far as the materials are concerned, but the I-drive I have some concerns about.   It's funny but Mercedes with their W140 set the way for the supreme luxury car with Lexus and now to a lesser extent BMW following it in terms of construction, tall styling and size.  But Mercedes unfortunately listened to mainly a bunch of auto writers and other non-owners and abandoned the over-the-top concept of the W140 car, just when Lexus and again to a lesser extent BMW are adopting the more concept.  The BMW 760iL will easily be the best luxury car in the world when it arrives.   The Mercedes and Lexus will be sent back to the drawing boards for their mid-life facelifts, around 2003 or 2004 for the Benz and 2004 for the Lexus.  Now sit back and await Mr Piech's answer to both with new A8 sometime next year.   How I wish I were an actual BUYER in this lofty group.M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Well we obviously differ greatly on design concerning the C-Class.  I think it's one of the best looking cars in its class, especially in ""Sport"" trim with the bigger wheels/tires.  Between the G35 Coupe and TL, I'd probably have to go with the G35.  They both have about the same power, but the G35 Coupe looks so much better than the TL.  If only the G35C had a better interior. Something about BMW's new choice of direction in styling has turned me off to the whole brand.  That combined with not wanting a new 3Series (the last good looking one left) have ruled BMW out for me.  It used to be Mercedes, BMW and Audi in my book.  Now it's Mercedes, Audi, with BMW a distant third. Can't explain it, just don't want one now. Though we disagree on some things your advice is always appreciated.  Wouldn't you know it the only used Euro cars I would want are either too expensive (CLK430) or are a little too troublesome for even me to buy....would love a 2001, or 2002 Audi A6 4.2.  Still debating that one. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Well with the new 5, I've had some time to actually see it on the roads in more real world surroundings.  Now I must be clear, only the models with the bigger wheels and tires are ""actually attractive"" imo.  The folks who buy the 525i and 530i with the standard wheels are still getting a car I can't whole heartedly endorse as being good looking, none of the 5Series models are for that matter.  However I kinda see what Bangle was going for with the 5Series, I can't explain it, but I'd say he did a much better job on the 5 than he did the 7.  Trust me it still isn't anEClass or A6 (previous model) to me..so I wouldn't say I'd done quite a 180 degree turn,  but it does look at lot better than the 7Series. As always I enjoy your analysis on styling, the reason I asked your opinion of the CLS in the first place.   Ah...the CLS, another car I'm starting like more and more, though it is about as far away from traditional MB design as possible.   Your comments about its shape, lines and treatments are spot on, imo.   I personally would have liked a blocky or more squarish back end like the S on the CLS.   I agree about the interior, though my problem is more or less they used too manyEClass pieces, this car should have been completely different and daring, like the exterior is, for a MB that is. ____________The transmission debate.   No automatic or SMG, F1, or DSG type tranny will take the place of a true 3-pedal, lever operated manual for the purest of enthusiasts.  No question.  That said, my vote for the next best thing is Audi's DSG gearbox.  The transmission is different from the rest of the automated manuals out there right now.  Unlike the SMG/F1 type trannnies offered by BMW, Ferrari, Aston-Martin, Mercedes, Toyota, and Maserati, the Audi DSG unit functions pretty well in automatic mode, which truth be told is how most of these trannies will be operated most of the time, otherwise the person would have bought the traditional manual in the first place.   The Audi system uses dual clutches and doesn't give that jerky, hesitation of all the other auto/manuals.  Test drive the Audi TT 3.2 if you don't believe me.  No it still doesn't shift as seamlessly as regular torque converter automatic, but its real close and much smoother than BMW's M3 SMG system is in automatic mode.  Ferrari and Toyota MR2 owners complain the loudest about how awful there F1-style trannies behave in automatic mode while in stop-n-go traffic.   I've hear similar stories about the Aston-Martin Vanquish and Maserati Sypder too.   Which is why I'm shocked that Maserati would see a luxury sedan, the Quattroporte with essentially the same (with some changes) gearbox. A regular automatic with manual shifting capability isn't even close to comparing to a true manual when it comes to feeling in control of or being at one with the car. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Well you know what I think of the A8 W12's new grille.  I think it fits perfectly.  Gives the car real presence.   Mercedes and Bruno Sacco are done from everything I've read.  He is apparently still ""close"" (whatever that means) to the company but he isn't running the design studios.  Oh well, not even Mercedes, BMW or Audi can make a gorgeous car every time.  They used too, but not anymore.  The 7, 5, 6 has proven BMW can't and the CLK and Maybach have proven the same with Mercedes.   I guess Mercedes felt the need to do a radical change with at least one of their cars since all their recent re-designs were conservative and safe.   Despite all the criticism of the 7Series, like others have just pointed out and like I pointed out a few months back during all that gloom and dooms sales talk here about BMW , the 2002+  7Series has sold better than the 1995-2001 model ever did.   Hence MB, and even Acura (have you seen the rear of the new TL?) may not see it as a such a big risk in doing something radical. ""By the way - you are hard on Lexus - I think you know that - but I've always found you pretty honest and frank on MB despite your favoritism there.""You know what, the only reason I'm ""hard"" on Lexus is because some here are just as ""hard"" on Mercedes and/or BMW.  I happen to like the GX470 and I still think the SC430 is an ""interesting"" car.   I've always seen Mercedes for what they are, problems and all.  Its the baseless and unfounded hype that invades this board and the news and views boards sometimes that sends the bs meter into the red.   Especially the rhetoric about sales that isn't even based on anything and the ever preached gloom and doom/crisis talk based on it.  When Mercedes has a model that cools down in sales it is crisis, yet when Lexus has one that hasn't sold well in years we get (not from you) all types of different excuses and it isn't seen as a crisis.  You'd think that MB or BMW don't have any bestsellers at all per the tone on this board at times.   You know what I mean?   All that bad talk about the 7 and that it has done so well reminds me of when you say the car rags don't know what they're talking about...and I'm thinking that they've harped on and on about the 7's styling and idrive since 2002 and the car still has outdone the previous 7Series.  Most (not all) of the people on these boards who complain the loudest about the styling probably wouldn't have bought a 7Series BMW anyway is my thinking. The car mags aren't marketing people so they really don't have a clue as to what will or won't sell ultimately. BMW sales are up due to the X3 first and then the 6-Series.  The 7 is down and the 5 is about even with last year.   Now worldwide they outsold Mercedes in May, and they might do it for the year if the 1Series catches on because Mercedes' A-Class doesn't go on sale until fall.  BMW's 3 and 7 have cooled a bit worldwide, which is at least somewhat expected of the 3Series.  The car is its 6th model year. The Paris autoshow in Sept of this year is going to be a ""really big show"".   Lots of German debuts. VW doesn't have a bad looking car in their showroom.  They all define that conservative, yet handsome look that Audi/VW is so good at projecting.   The Touareg is one of the few SUVs that I like, that interior is the best going imo this side of a Range Rover.   It along with the GX470, Cayenne and Range Rover would be on my list if I had the money and desire for a luxury SUV.   The Phaeton is a smashingly handsome car, but it is a pointless exercise in VW showroom. VW needs to improve reliability and get the new Jetta, Passat here ASAP.  Though both of these cars are still very handsome and look timeless to me they are dated in features, engines etc. compared to the newer Korean and Japanese competition.  VW needs small SUV to compete with the RAV4s and Escapes of the world.  I want a sports car from them like that R Concept they showed at Frankfurt last year.  Phaeton misstep aside VW is here to stay. Have you and Lexusguy seen the comparo in the Aug issue of C&D?  Awesome group of cars! M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Well you've assumed wrong.  I've examined both cars over and over and time and time again.   The reason I asked him about such a thing is because it's funny to me that one would be able to gauge how well a car is built bodywise but can't tell the difference in the drive....thats very interesting to say the least.   When I think about ""body build"" I'm talking about the solidity of the body, how the doors close etc, and yes paint and body panel fits, not lots of wood and leather than anyone can have in a car. No Mercedes doesn't build them as tank-like anymore, the last such Benz was the 1992-1999 W140 SClass and ironically your (R129) SL.  Any of these cars, LexusLS, S, 7, XJ, A8 or Pheaton would be hard pressed to be as rigid as the W126 (1981-1991)SClass.  If you built a car with steel and sheet metal that thick and pack on the features today's car require you'd wind up with a car of Maybach heft.  That particular SClass was engineered to take a direct hit front or rear at 65 mph and still allow the doors to open and close freely. Another reason I asked because on this board especially you'd read these post and think a Mercedes doesn't even compare, and at times it's a little ridiculous.  I think the SClass is a about the best balance product out there considering all the optional features coupled with arguably the best safety engineering around.   They had to come down from the previous car, add way more features and lower the price at the same time, so yes a few trim pieces might not on the same level as before, but again on this board the Benz (according to some, not all) is so terrible and that is what I find to be downright ridiculous.  Lexus on the other hand starts with one car and then covers two segments, smart yes...but I find the LexusLS to be the most boring car in the segment, quality or not.  It's a yawn box. About your car, I agree your dealer is awful and such behavior is equally ridiculous.  So they've never been able to fix your car? M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've never been a fan of the LexusES, but many like it and the RX is perfect for it's market. The LX470 is a classic, albeit outdated style and the SC430 I have liked from day one. Your problem is you want every car to be a racy design and then the line-up is a hit - in your view of course which is not held by the buying public. Otherwise how would Lexus even selll a car. But MB never had any widespread sporty or racy designs and as OAC states it really all started with the headlights on the E in 96 and accelerated with the new S design in 2000. Before that they were bland cars and of course much higher quality relative to the market.Yes my wife and I always had a desire for that old SClass but looking at it now in that picture it is a boxy very bland design.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                What a ridiculous myth. If anyone believes that I've got some nice old ""valuables"" to sell them.Boo20 - I understand your point and agree with you completely. But I have an LX470 which treats 2 ft. of snow like a car treats a 2 inch hill pile of dirt. Nonetheless I, like Syswei, wish Lexus would make AWD available in the LexusLS. But my old boss, who had the a8 I drove occasionally in the past (and it was a nightmare and in the shop so often I lost count of it) had to put snows on in winter otherwise the car was not that effective in the snow even with AWD. That is according to him as I never drove it in the snow. But from a financial standpoint (and since I prefer an LexusLS over an SClass) I could lease an LexusLS and a  RX  for a tad more than an  SClass AWD and I'd go that route first. But that is me. Now with all that said I will tell you that I love the  SClass and would be driving it (probably with AWD) if Lexus wasn't around. I think MB's reliability is far removed from Audi but it seems very difficult for anyone to replicate the exceptional reliability the Japanese have brought to the table. But if anyone can it will be MB and possibly BMW in the longrun. But only if both fix the issues at hand without rushing onto the next level. I'm convinced that is why MB reliability has slipped so much. I don't for a second think its the engineering or drivetrains.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                What are you talking about?  What magazine has ever said anything about a Benz looking like a Ford?  Don't give me the instance in which some woman off the street said something about the SClass looking like a Taurus.  Show me where a automotive writer has drawn such an conclusion.    What magazine said this? Your second paragraph about the Taurus is just your wild fantasy.  Why in the world would European makers be upset by a mass-market car like the Taurus that doesn't even compete with them in any sort of way.   Secondly, the Cadillac Sixteen isn't going to be built, nor has any European maker borrowed anything from it.   No you always say that I'm just making things up, yet you have absolutely no basis for all this wild stuff you're talking about now.  None. What you'll never get is that Audi's A8, Jaguar's XJ and BMW's 7Series don't look anything like each other.  You haven't even seen the 04' LexusLS in person yet right?  How can you say it hasn't taken cues from the currentSClass, especially the 03'SClass' facelift?   You're right there is a definite difference between copying and borrowing details.  The current LexusLS is about as close to a copy of the old SClass as legally possible.   Now they've gone and slicked back the front and added clear sections to the tailights to resemble the current S. You're right about something else, there are a lot of cars that end up looking similar, but when we're talking about a 20K compared to a 80K I'm more inclined to think that it's more of two companies thinking alike more than borrowing or even a sheer coincidence.   You can't tell me for a minute that Lexus just accidently made the LexusLS look like the old S and now by the same coincidence the 04' facelift just so happened to borrow from theSClass, the car that is sole reason for the ls/430's being.  It's amazing that one would see the resemblance between a Ford and Benz, but can't see it in Lexus' main reason for exisiting.   Of course Mercedes isn't all original all the time, but they were a lot more so before someone began copying any and everything from them.   Truth be told the only brand the lacks originality in the luxury market now is Lexus, they've admitted as much and have stated that a family look is coming for all their cars.  It's about time.  The sole reason that copying is dismissed because it's Lexus thats doing it, but yet a Benz looks like a Ford and thats news.  But you're right the copying issue is done so we'll just have to agree to disagree as we have over the past 4 years and move on.  Lets talk about something else. Oh and you're going to love this, I hate the CLS.  It doesn't look like a Mercedes at all, it's horrible. sv7887, I'm done with that issue after this post, but to answer to some of your questions see above post to ljflx.

Regardless I believe Toyota markets the LexusLS in America at least, as its flagship car but I could be wrong.Ejerod - I'm still a lot better off in the market than out of it over a three year period but I'd love to have the past year back. escargo - LexusLS is more roomy for front passengers but the SClass should be more roomy in back given the extra 7 inches of car length.

No car in it's class out-steers, out-corners, out-manuvers the perinnial 3Series . And with the 3Series  getting the 3Series C's new 310-hp twin-turbo I-6, that acceleration lead over the Bimmer will end soon enough, especially seeing how in BMW(and Audi) fashion, you'll be able to row your own.Yes the BMW sales figures were off unexpectedly.

Although I'm very fond of the VW AG company, Porsche will never ever concede all rights to VW, no matter how good the offer. With the most profit per car sold in any company, why would the risk it? They have complete control over style/powertrain decisions(something that was written is stone with the Q7, T'Regg, Cayenne alliance)...On Tokyo Express, they mentioned that the lswill have an app. start of 58.5k, with the range topping LS600hL stopping short of 90k.

"                What you're saying about the EPA mpg figures is correct and also well-known.  In fact Lexus wanted to put lower figures in their ads but EPA rules don't allow for that.However your post seems to have missed the point that hybrid offers a simultaneous  increase in economy and performance.  Both hp and torque get bumped up, all while saving fuel....just try to name another recently-developed technology that does the same.  For instance, Lexus rates the RX400h at 7.3 sec, 0-60, compared to 7.8 for the  RX .  Car and Driver tested the 400h at 6.9 sec, so the actual improvement may be greater than Lexus suggests.Couple that with the emissions reduction, further increases in gasoline prices (imho), expected cost reductions as hybrid technology matures, an eventual erosion in dealer markups, and further technology improvements (i.e., the LS600h should offer better performance improvements than the RX400h), and you will have a major major technology.  There is a reason that car companies other than Honda and Toyota are falling all over themselves trying to address this technology.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"                When I'm on the highway with a phenomenal luxury car under me, basked in a luxurious interior, the best stereo I've ever heard in a car blaring away, trusting in bulletproof reliability backed up by experience and proof from worldwide surveys by first class companies the last thing in the world I care about is some brands racing heritage or the fact that it won some event in 1912. If I'm buying a car to race around an oval I'll give that stuff consideration. Get real. Whoever said Audi wasn't a lux brand? It's just last on the totem pole and many don't give it serious consideration. That's the way it is and that's why it sells so few A8's and most of its sales are skewed to A4's. Lexus will outsell it by 30K units with the RX alone and just from that vehicle will sell at a higher average sale price than Audi's whole car line in the US. That's the reality of the situation. Nothing wrong with loving an A8 but to have to justify buying it because of a racing heritage is way too far out for me.Posted this once before but even though the A8 got the most wanted label in Edmunds, it scored lower than the lsby Edmunds itself, as did all  the other German marques. So much for racing heritage.http://www.edmunds.com/new/audi/index.html?tid=edmunds.n.maininde- x.content..0.*http://www.edmunds.com/new/2005/lexus/ls430/index.html?tid=edmund- s.n.mmindex.content.num6.0.lexus*            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                When you read through it all - lack of styling (despite the fact that it supposedly ""copies"" what is referenced as a beautifully styledSClass) and lack of passion (per auto mags) are the only two knocks on the LexusLS. The fact that both are subjective opinions seems to be lost on everyone. I learned a long time ago that if you can't find something wrong with a tangible item than you don't have much of a case or argument. I got all A's in Logic in college so the first point is ""totally illogical"" to me as Spock would say and would result in an ""F' grade. I mean - either both cars have no style or both have good style. But you can't have it both ways and personally though I like both cars, I prefer the lsto the old SClass exterior (and much more so on the interior) anyway. Lack of passion is just as funny. Sure it lacks passion if you want to compare it to the very, very low sales of an S55. But to an ordinary SClass or a Jag - no way. To an A8 or a 7 - probably but the ride of the A8 was downright bad and I haven't been  in a 7Series so I can't say. But I'd bet a 7 doesn't ride anywhere near as well as an lsor an S.What I find downright amusing is the whole copying issue. It is written as if it is universal to the whole brand by some but in fact is only in one car which represents about 10-15% of all Lexus sales. In 2006 or 2007 that will end. Plus they will have a tuning arm so the passion nonsense will also end. Someone better hope for a tangible argument soon because they are running out of road.Lastly - I never met anyone who buys a car and doesn't like its styling. I can only guess that this becomes increasingly important as the price climbs to $60k+.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Whenever the assembly line is re-tooled to produce a new design - as is the case right now with the RX300 - you have lower production and hence lower sales. The plant is operating usually at 33% less efficiency. That is also why the new model takes a while to reach full production after it is introduced. LexusLS sales dropped to 14,000 in its last year and zoomed to 33,000 in 2001 with the new model. Don't read anything into sales stats in the last year of a model - its a production issue not a sales issue.For Merc 1 - Acura Legend and please lighten up a bit. It was a great car. Like my 95 LexusLS a friend bought it and took my 60k break-in miles to over 300k miles before the car started to have problems. The 95 LexusLS has over 200k miles and is still functioning well. I must do something right when these cars are in their baby years though I do drive them hard and fast.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"                Well, you know, I'm not going to disagree for a second that Lexus vehicles on average are more isolated that BMW.  I say, so what?  As a business strategy, it makes sense to be known for something, and to serve a market segment well.  Lexus is known for luxury over sport...how can I disagree with that?If they tried with every model to be just like the equivalent BMW model, it would hurt them as a company, because there is only a certain part of the market that WANTS a BMW-type vehicle, and Lexus would then have to split that part of the market with BMW.It is smarter to keep the identity they have with the LexusLS, LexusES, and SUVs, and, now that success has been established there, at the margin with select models or new models, try to address other segments.  The IS tried to do this, not so succesfully the first time at bat, and as you say we'll see what the second at-bat brings.  It looks like the I SClass will be the first attempt at an AMG/M type vehicle, and we'll just have to see how it fares.  I really don't personally find it that important, since I'm not the sport type buyer, and since the AMG/M/RS types, as we discussed, are a miniscule part of the market.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"                While the debate rages on Audi, Lexus, BMW and HELM, it is important that we clarify the premise to which these debates are being made. Lost here is if indeed everyone is clear about what it is to be a HELM player ? I'd like to take a stab at defining and clarifying our forum here.HELM - High-End Luxury Marque. On the face of it, it could mean many things: cars, companies, exotics, etc. But the HELM we talk about here refers to the CAR, and that's why these cars are clearly listed at the top of this board. By definition, the CAR must be a high-end car, with luxury appointments and should be a marque car. Heritage is only one aspect, not the key factoid... Now to a clarification: A HELM company can make many HELM cars, but only one HELM car is needed to qualify. Put another way, a car company only needs to make a car that meets these definitions, to become a HELM company.Audi A8/A8L and A8 W12 are all HELM cars. Ditto Lexus' LexusLS, soon to be a whole series of LSs - 460/460L/600h/600hL. MB has the SClass/S600/S63/S65 as HELM cars in this space, and BMW has the trio of 7Series/7SeriesL/760iL. All of these cars fit our HELM definition. Are these cars not high-end ? Yes. Are they not luxurious ? Yes they are. Are they not marque cars ? Yes they are, for each of the car companies.... Absolutely! That is what we are talking about here on this board.As HELM car makers, MB, Audi and BMW are solid HELM companies by virtue of their HELM stable of cars, however Lexus makes it into the HELM club by virtue of the lsseries. Without the LexusLS, Lexus will just be known as the luxury arm of Toyota, much as Infiniti and Acura are today. And that's why these latter companies are NOT included in the HELM player space.Finally, a word on Merc1's tier structures for HELM. Here I will agree with Doc that we should classify the ultra-high end exotic cars - Lambos, Ferraris, Bugattis, Aston Martins, Bentleys, and Maybach - into the class they truly belong - EXOTIC HELMs. These cars are niche products, sold only to the infinitesimal 0.0001% of the world buyers.... How can we lump these into the mainstream HELM cars which are somewhat affordable for the 99% of the mass population ?Hope that these definitions and clarifications help.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Who would I like to work for? It depends on how much $$$ you'd like to make. One reason for Porsche being so profitable is that it has relatively low labor costs. Audi/VW on the other hand(maybe even DCX's Euro arm), they make a fairly decent living.As far as Audi being a step behind Lexus, let's put this into perspective:Up until recently('06 m/y), the entire Lexus line was very lackluster and in serious need of attention. The IS300 was definetely nothing to write home about, the dull as a B-seg movie GS was very long in the tooth and became wholly undesirable in light of very fresh and entertaining competition(ie: 5Series, A6,EClass), despite their first ever major incentives to push them out of the door. The SCgets knocked over by the SL, XK, Porsche Cab, even XLR. And the LexusLS, the very car(matter of fact the only car) that makes them a so-called HELM. Yes, reliable. Yes, sales by the ton. Yes, competitive(price wise). But the car is as fun as watching paint dry, while every single other HELM has at least some sporting variant(BTW: the laughable Euro-Suspension hardly counts). In typical Lexus fashion, they're almost always late to the game. The new lswill undoubtly bring a fresh face to the game, but a threat to it's main competitor, the SClass? Highly doubtful. And the LS600hL may be blazen with technology, but with only 430hp, all it's technology seems superficial. And the fuel econ numbers I've seen aren't anything special, maybe 2 mpg better than the class norm(as a matter of fact, the supposed 18/25 is akin to a Jag XJ, the other ""non-HELM car"".)This is in no way discounting Lexus. The brand has addressed most of America's gripes(altho I don't think the lswill have the 7Series or  SClass shaking in their boots). This was meant to show that all of the things you say make a HELM a HELM, some of it for the most part also affects the ""top-tier"" carmakers. Take a second and just think about it.

"                Where did Lexus sales come from?   Pretty much the same place BMW sales came from!   A full 1/3 of BMW sales come from the 3Series.   The 3Series is a great car!  It is not roomy, but it has everything else.  Good-looking, fun, versatile, fast, feature-laden, damn near hypnotic to drive, it's even easy to park!  And word-of-mouth takes it the rest of the way!   It offers a combination other cars can't in it's class.    The Lexus RX300/330/350 works in the same mysterious way.  It accounts for 1/3 of Lexus sales, and this will not change.   It is powerful, roomy, elegant, luxurious, versatile, and reeks of quality!  And good news travels just as fast.    The 3Series and the RX have one thing in common.      They are so good, you can't walk away from them.  They are the benchmarks.    Lexus has the LexusES, LexusLS, and RX with built in customer bases.  The rest of the lineup falls in around them, until further notice.   Lexus vehicles aren't the prettiest, or the most fun, but they eliminate the screw ups MORE COMMON in high-end German and American-engineered cars and SUVs.  That's all!   Lexus eliminates the ""Bitter Beer Face"" you may've seen elsewhere.    This loyal following has been cultivated over the past 17 years, and BMW has taken a similar path, offering a sporting, yet versatile (4-door), driving experience uncommon in the luxury car market.    It's not that Lexus will kill Mercedes.  It's just that they are the closest competitor as far as ""Mission Statement"".   They are trying to do the same thing, but both have very different ways of doing it.  And they are starting from different areas of the landscape/timeline.    Lexus is building a can't lose proposition for themselves.   Either they continue to absorb the lower-end of the luxury market, and scream value, or increase their appeal and prestige and move upmarket.   I'd like Team Europe to stand up and say a  SClass is $25k better than a LS460L.      Come on, all together now......   Ok, is it $10k better?  $5k?     Having stood next to both vehicles at the same time, I don't see how the lswill be a lesser vehicle, dynamically.  The only difference is the lshas never been an $80k-90k vehicle, while the S has been for awhile.   Lexus can change that paradigm, if they so choose.  I'd like to see them push the prestige envelope.  But they'd rather not mess with the Golden Goose.  Can you blame them?     The LS460 can do it, but Lexus/Toyota won't risk it, and the GS hasn't shown it can stand the $50k ground, so it would cause a chasm Lexus doesn't need.    I think I've run out of analysis.

But that's an equally silly point of view.I just bring it up to point out the shallowness of your argument.   ? But this thing of saying your brand is superior because that's your buying preference has reached the ridiculous point.

We'll see where the new IS fits but it's a fork in the road for Lexus. It's past emphasis was not luxury or near luxury in my opinion and was served up too early by Lexus. All three Lexus SUV's are luxury vehicles to me. I would have left out the RX in the past but it has been greatly improved from what had been near lux. The X5 is there too as a lux suv but it's RX size. The ML is as bad as the IS in trying to figure out where it belongs. I think as brands Acura and Infiniti are near luxury.

Total curb weights are still sketchy right now, but I don't expect the mainstream LS460 to put drastically more weight on over the current model, especially since Toyota/Lexus has announced the more intense use of aluminum on this car. The hood,roof,trunklid, and all doors are said to be of aluminum. And If this reads out, then the LS460 could indeed slash up to a full second off of the 0-60 time of the current model, which could mean the gas-sipping/performance beast 600hL would have to be faster still, altho providing better f/e, much in the same way of the RX.

"                Wow!  You guys take this stuff too seriously.  They are just cars for crying out loud!  Perhaps people see their cars as extensions of themselves and when their cars get attacked, they take it too personally.In any event, I have a '98 E320 and recently purchased a '05 LexusLS.  I also had a '01 ML320 and traded-in for a new '03 Sequoia.  In my opinion, MB and Lexus are both very fine cars; one brand is not absolutely better than the other.  I love my E.  It is beautiful to look at, solid and realitively reliable throughout the years.  Unfortunately, the new E are simply too small for me to consider.  The ML was a fine truck (with very poor ride though), but again, it was too small for my needs and I had to trade up.Based on my ""limited"" MB experience, both my E and ML were pretty reliable without any major issues.  With respect to the LexusLS, it simply rides a dream.  It feels solid and yet has the soft Japanese touch and luxury.  It definitely feels different than MB, but I don't believe it is inferior in any way.The other models S, 7 and A8 are all fine automobiles in their own right.  However, the bottom line for me is that for $60Kish, LexusLS is a bargain and made most sense - price, size, quality, luxury & reliability.  If new E were about the same size, I would have bought the E.  If the S were little cheaper and more reliable, I would have bought the S.  For the same money, I would take the S over a8 any day (personally, I don't consider Audi and MB to be in the same class).  The 7 is simply too ugly for me to even consider.By the way, the recent Luxury SUV movement was likely started by Lincoln Navigator back in the mid 90's.These are my 2 cents.

It surely isn't the E vs the GS, S vs LexusLS, SClass vs SC, C vs IS.   Yes the ES330 does outsells the C-Class and your statement applies (factually) about Mercedes in the SUV market.  Other wise such a broad generalzation:  ""but those sales are slipping relative to their competition."" simply isn't based on anything factual. Price not withstanding, Mercedes' cars sell very well, across the board, not just certain models like Lexus. syswei, "" I certainly do see high prices as a handicap hindering MB sales.""Finally, that was my point.  Your implication earlier was that Mercedes didn't sell better simply because the market didn't think they were worth the extra $$$, while assuming that everyone buying a competiting Lexus could afford the competing Benz model, yet chose a Lexi. I never said Lexus wasn't without their own ""handicaps"".   Then you still say that Lexus outsells Mercedes, again true, but long as you know why this is so.  It isn't because of what you tried to imply earlier.     Lexus' so called handicaps, arguably aren't anything compared to a brand like Mercedes taking the amount of bad press they've taken over the last few years.   To put it in the best Lexus fashion, heritage and unaffordable AMG/V12 models don't mean much when the everyday C320 andSClasss are unreliable. ""So MB has 3 variants that are priced lower than the very cheapest Lexus, yet looking at the sales numbers for the total lineup, still doesn't outsell Lexus.""Wrong.  The C-Class outsells the IS300 by a huge margin.  It isn't even close.   Also, I'd like for you to checkout your local Benz dealers lot and tell me if you see any base cars sitting around at those prices you listed.  You do realize that that ""$29,999"" stuff is one of the oldest get-you-in-the-showroom tricks around, Mercedes is just as guilty of using this as anybody else. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Yeah, I'm pretty sure they will build a hybrid LexusLS, based on the success of RX400h sales.  Has Lexus said they will build a hybrid LS?  I haven't seen any specific information on a lshybrid. So what's the point of hyping something you know basically nothing about?            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                yes differences do exist but they are by all means slight today.  15 years ago, there were night and day differences between cars, such as the LexusLS was lot more luxurious than the 7Series and the 7Series was in turn alot more sporty same with the 7Series vs. the SClass in 1990 vs. today.  In the last 15 years as Lexus helped BMW discover that american luxury car buyers look for a quiet supple ride over handling and today you have a 7Series that is alot more cushy than in 1990 and not as sporty as it was in 1990. I loved the late 80s 735i, it might not have had the power but it was a wonderful road carver(even by today's standards) and had direct/natural steering.  Today, the various cars in the class, 745, LexusLS,SClass, A8, STS are all on a converging path. ""If you drove a 2001 7Series  Sport back to back with a 2001-2003 LexusLS you would feel a much bigger difference.""What's the point of a Sport vs. regular ls?

"                Yes I mean copy, especially with the LexusLS.  Now the first generation LexusLS was not as blatant as the LexusLS is now, I'll give you that.  Actually the first generation LexusLS took a lot from the SClass and 7Series of the time.  No, not an exact duplicate (i.e. ls) but still way too much similarity for me. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Yes I'm liking the Maserati more and more.  I especially find the interior to be such a relief from the regular business like interiors of theSClass, 7Series, A8 and LexusLS.  It's so sensual and scultped...the only thing close in this reguard is a Jaguar's interior.   The Quattroporte is exactly what it should be, different from all the rest.  I can't wait to see the car in person. Well I didn't get a chance to see a Maybach at the Benz dealer, they didn't have any around.  I guess this strictly by order thing is for real. We looked at the Acura TL-S, TSX, Passat W8, and the Infiniti G35.   Now I'll tell you honestly the G35 Coupe could be my next car whenever I decide I want another car note, I haven't had one since 2000.  I love the power and styling overall.  I'm not crazy about the rather thick looking rear bumper on the coupe, and some pieces of the interior are cheap feeling/looking.   Anyway back to the sedans, which is why we went in the first place.   My friend likes the G35 sedan the best, he as did his uncle hated the TSX, mainly because in automatic form its too slow.   We'll go back to the Acura dealer in early Oct to see the new TL.  The salesmen were talking as its going to re-write the rules of the entry level market...we'll see.   The Passat W8 is almost impossible to find in the Sport configuration.  The regular W8 is ok, but it really does need the sportier chassis setup to appreciate the W8 engine.  I stand in awe of the Toureg, it's got a knockout interior, and in V8 form is a very complete truck.   Dealer says the big vee-dub will be here in Oct, with the V8 going for about 60K and the W12 for about 75K.  Can't wait to see that. Where are you in your decisions for 2004?  Range Rover, SL500 and ls?  Or is it LexusLS, SL500 and LX470 or GX470?  I guess you can tell I really want you to try one European car huh..M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Yes it only diminishes the Lexus brand in the eyes of people such as yourself. You haven't addressed any of my points in my previous posts either. Lastly, JD powers has nothing to do with it. Do you think all the people out there who bought the LexusLS,  RX , ES330, (way more owners overall than Audi, and more than MB as well) think that their cars are somehow diminished because their vehicles are heavily upgraded versions of Toyotas? They're happy to get highly rated, high quality, ,safe, luxurious, tech-advanced vehicles at a good value. I think most of us think- damn, how does Lexus do it? Now that's the mark of a good luxury vehicle manufacturer!            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Yes syswei, Audi outsells BMW. Primarily on the heels of the A6, the world's best selling premium car, followed be the A4(and it's 11 variants, 6 of which we can't get). Audi is one of those compannies that you have to watch. Even with the many posters who shall remain nameless say that Audi isn't a true or ""tierless"" HELM, the maker is on a big path to spread it's talent. Starting with the RS4, the RS 6 which will be here next spring(with the Gallardo's 510hp/500lb ft V10 and dry-sump), and the R8/10/12. The company is very serious about head-butting MB in the sport class. Then you have the '09 A7, which will feature a CLS-esque design cue and S7 variant, and of course the big kahuna, the new '09 A8. This car's base form will be a 4.2L 450-hp V8, followed by the S8 600hp V12(this go around), and a 400hp/710lb-ft of torque uber-clean V12 TDI w/ Micro Trap.I have nothing but astounding confidence in this maker. The company has demonstrated the talent and know-how in manufacturing world-class cars. But......BMW won't sit idley. The new 7 is coming, along with a first ever M7. The 3Series is getting a bump in hp over the 300 mark for '07, and the refreshed 5 is due in '08. The successor to the Z8 is also on the books....Maybe this is why the Germans posted the strongest gains in history this quarter, especially with the blazen new product over at MB.....

"                Yes, Cadillac will drop the Seville name and there will be no ""SLS"" trim.  The interior not up to the MB/Audi standard?  Why is that?  I mean obviously we haven't been physically inside the car but in terms of design and appearance, it's certainly no worse that any other car.  First off, audi interiors are boring.  The A8's is a little better but there are buttons all over the lower console along with MMI which I thought was supposed to eliminate the problem of too many buttons.  the current A6 doesn't even have a freakin nav screen in the dash.  The new A6 looks all business like, not inviting at all.  i won't even touch MB interiors.  COMAND is simply nonsense.  The look and design are pretty average, nothing to write home about and the quality is not what you'd expect for something costing as much as they do (especially theSClass).            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Yes, I also drove the new A8.  Of course the salesperson was quick to tell me that she's getting many SClass owners who are trading in.  May be true or exaggerated.It is a very impressive machine.  Drives similar to the BMW while the cabin is a bit more luxurious than the bimmer although conservative compared to Lexus.It is very quick for it's size and gives a nice growl. It handles very well for a car that size but for me size takes it out of the equation.  For now, only the long wheel base is available and believe me, it's long.  I felt like a chauffeur driving it.  The shorter wheel base is on the way for fall.  I think the car to watch next may be the new A6.  Supposedly, it will have many of the attributes of the A8 in a smaller package and a big 8 cylinder from the S8 to boot.I won't consider because I'm a bit leery of first year models from Audi but it should be a winner.By the way, interesting to note is that MB is dropping free maintanince in 05.  (they only provided oil changes vs Audi an BMW who include all wear items except tires).  Strange strategy for a brand suffering perceived reliability problems.Perhaps they will offset with longer warranty or something.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Yes, Lexus has said the hybrid will spread beyond the RX400h. But it hasn't said how much it will spread. Lexus also hasn't said how much horsepower a supposed lshybrid would have. So, I do not know where all these claims of 600bhp and so on come from.  Not just that but the more ridiculous claim of the lshybrid basically being a monster car that will put all other competitors to shame is a bold and ridiculous statement 3 years before the new lscomes out.  Second, that would imply Mercedes, BMW, Infiniti are just going to stand still while Lexus moves forward.  Now, we all know how much B.S. that is. And the press is usually less than 100% accurate on stories. After all, they do have to sell issues & get advertising dollars. Blowing news out of proportion is one way they do it.

"                Yes, the verdict on the 2002 Q45 is very positive, and I would say it's competes very well with the LexusLS, 7Series ,SClass, for thousands less.   It's styling & lack of trunk space are 2 big negative's. And of course the biggest problem with the new Q45 really isn't about the Q45 but about the Infiniti brand's missteps for the last decade. If Infiniti did a better job on the styling, they would have a real winner on their hands.Motor Trend says the Q45 is a good car too, just not as good as the other cars in it's class like the A8,SClass, & LexusLS.

"                Yes, I have stated that Lexuses ofter remind me of a Buick if more so in concept than in driving, depending on the model.  Of course a Lexus drives better is easily 5 times the car, when it comes to build and engineering etc etc, but what they do share is the same philosophy.  Neither of them are really that satisfying to drive.  They're both dull in styling and design and do nothing for the lust factor, and they both cater to being quiet and lush above all else.  There is never any mention of actual driving.    Incidently, the press has also said this same thing, especially about the SC430 and the ES300.   Buick also just identified Lexus as their target, so obviously they see some similarities.   Again, I'm not saying that Lexuses are buicks, I'm saying that aren't worlds apart either.  They're more similar than not. ljflx, The A8 is no different than any other awd car, it has to have the correct tires for the awd to be effective.   All these  SClass 4Matic Sport owners around here are going to have to do the same thing (switch tires) once it snows. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Yes. I do see why retirees like the LexusLS. It is conservative, cushy, insulating the driver from any road feel. Very light on steering. Very comfortable seats. Good brakes.A lot of folks(not only retirees) desire exactly these things and Lexus delivers. This is the ""luxury"" experience that they have perfected.To each his/her own. I wouldn't like or respect anybody less because he/she drives an LexusLS!I also drove the GS 430 and Lexus is more on target for me with this vehicle.Steering very well-weighted. Excellent cornering. Good straight-line acceleration. Brakes stop on a dime. Probably the best handling Lexus ever created.I would like to see the autorags do a comparison of the GS430 to the BMW 545 and the Audi A6. That should prove interesting!            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                you all have to remember that audi's name was falsely tarnished by 60 minutes, and they later apologized for their poor reporting.  in Europe, audis sell the same as MB and more than BMW.  audi is still recovering from this, but with such good cars as the A4 and A6 and A8, they have created car that are better than MB and BMW.  look at autosite, and for luxury pics, the A8 gets the ultimate pic twice, same asSClass.  and it is older.  no 7Series.  the A8 doesnt impress as much as the SClass to people who dont know cars. it is class without flash and mass.  the SClass is  a great car but has questionable interior plastic and a weird COMAND system.  the A8 does have a better quality interior.  MB and BMW quality are also not exactly stellar  compared to audi...in consumer reports, the A6 and  EClass  had the same reliablility. it was only average.  they dont mention the SClass or A8. the S has horrible problems with the suspension and electricals now. the E has glitches after 4 years.  the A6 has glitches too.  the 5 has glitches. no cars have incredible reliability. all are good.

"                Yes, the I35 is smaller than the LexusLS.  It is in the same size category as the Lexus LexusES, but has a much more hospitable rear seat.

My mom has one and there is no doubt, you feel the road more in the I35.As far as clout, I find that in the general population (those who aren't into cars enough to be on these boards), Infiniti carries close to the same clout as Lexus.

"                Maybe the term ""Loser"" causes this confusion and greyish area.    I would call that term rather severe, given we're dealing with relatively successful cars, like Escalade and SC430.  Maybe instead of calling them ""losers"", which is probably inaccurate, maybe some people mean ""undesirable""?  A lot of people might condiser the A8 ""desirable"".  But is it a ""Winner""?  People aren't really buying it.  It sell 5k a year?  I like it a lot, but calling a car like that a ""Winner"" takes some thought.  If it were really a ""Winner"", wouldn't it sell more?    Escalades and Sc430s may not be ""desirable"" to you and others, but they are to many, enough people to make them ""winners"", at least to owners and their respective makers.    I'm not a fan of cars like CLK or ES330/350, but I can't call them ""Losers"", can I?  They are too popular to be ""Losers"".  Doesn't that make sense?  The way I see it, in the luxury game, if you can sell enough so that field isn't lapping you, you are ""winning"" sales, and returning your maker a profit.  You can fund a redesign, based on some reasonable market acceptance.  Cars like Pheaton and XLR are almost assured of being nothing more than a luxury footnote.  Regarding the SC430, having sat in the SLK, SL, and SC430, but not the XLR, bringing Lexus values and traits to this convertible class is exactly what makes an SC430 valuable, or a ""winner"".  You seem to discount that ""Lexus traits"" are HIGHLY DESIRABLE to thousands of buyers.  Lets say the SClass is more enjoyable to drive, and is better looking.  These are subjective standards, and with similar power (Until recently), and a $25k higher price tag, an SC430 becomes a smart buy!  You will disagree, but I find the SCinterior to be noticably more opulent than either the SLK or SL.  The SLK is quite small, and I barely fit inside.  The SClass is a little roomier than the Lexus, and has a nice interior, but Lexus has clearly laid the lux on thick compared to the understated SClass interior.    SC= luxury felt  SClass = luxury driven  Lexus nailed the pricing, and made the XLR seem like a rough draft, for an extra $10k, in comparison.  It is a good value compared to the SLK, due to engine and chassis size, and much more luxury inside.  Bear in mind, the SC430 IS NOT MY KIND OF CAR!  I wouldn't buy one!  But I see value and luxury in it.  Cadillac hasn't earned the right to sell premium convertibles, much less for more than Lexus.  And competing with legendary cars like XK and SClass for sales, and holding it's own, unlike the XLR, should bring respect, if not admiration from detractors.  We will not see another XLR, but a ""L-Finesse"" designed SC460 for 2008 will prove the line has plenty of merit, and a bright future.  DrFill            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"                Yes, there's a silver '00 Jag XKR in my garage. Its my third Jag convertible, my first was a '96 XJ-S. Since the Ford takeover, Jag reliability has steadily improved. My '96 wasn't terrible, but it wasnt that great, either. The problems it had were all electrical though, no major mechanical issues. My next car was a '98 XK8, which was much better. It also had some issues, but not nearly as much as the XJ-S. My current R has again improved a lot over the '98. The Jaguar AJ-V8 is used in the Lincoln LexusLS, the S-type, the XJ, and the XK. I've not heard of any of them being plauged with engine failures. I know I've never had to replace any of mine.  I own two Lexus cars and the Jag. The Jag cant come close to my wife's RX or my LexusLS in terms of a spotless record, but compared to what I've been hearing from friends who have recent MB LexusES or SLs, its been fantastic. I think as long as you are very careful about making sure the car has been well cared for by its previous owner and is thoroughly checked before you buy, you should be ok.I wouldnt recommend the 7Series , those are just as bad as the Benz. If you want a BMW, a 540i is a much better choice.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I agree, the Audi A8 is truly a great car.Mine has served me well for over 150,000 miles, and still going strong.I have twoother Audis at my home in New Mexico, a 2004 A64.2 for my wife and a 2004 S4 formyself. In all, I have had twelve Audis,beginning with the Audi Quattro Sportin 1983.  ""American Idol"" may have a huge audience, but that does not make a great and memorable TV show. Popularity does notequate to quality or greatness.The only ""losers"", if there are any, arethose who fail to understand andappreciate the qualities of the A8. Afterall caviar too is an acquired taste.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                You face the same exact dilemma that I faced when shopping for my next AWD ride, I too tested the  SClass 4-Matic, and while not quite as sure footed as the Quattro, it did get the job done right. I don't know what part of the country you live in, but here in NY, the Quattro system proved to be better than some big honkin'4WD SUV's. I chose my A8 over the Benz because of Audi's complete blend of performance and luxury. No other car at the time(Fall-'05) offered what the W12 did. No car offered this much power in AWD, and they still don't. But don't get me wrong. I'm a MB fanatic also, having owned two in the last 5 years. The first a magnificently reliable SClass, and the second a stupid fast S65 AMG, which I regretedly sold to pursue my a8 W12. For what it's worth, the  SClass 4-Matic will be the closest thing in matching Audi's Quattro AWD. It retains the 40/60 split like on the quattro, but does without a LSD, a crucial piece in the mountain-goat-like surefootedness of the A8. And I must admit , Lexus has the LS600hL coming out, but from what Lexus released, the car will be 100% RWD until it feels the need for AWD. These systems have proved twitchy on ice covered roads and useless in most situations that you feel you need the AWD....            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                You know my personal feelings on this stuff. I just drove the new a8 and I'd much prefer the SClass (even with 5 speed) over it though it would be an SClass. I'd rate the lsfirst by a whisker over an  SClass based on my preferences and I'm using my 5 speed experience on that scoring. But I do wish Mercedes would improve the interior along the lines of the A8. The Audi, the Jag and the Lexus have stunning interiors. I actually think the 7 has the worst interior. It's just to much of a business club. I haven't driven the Jag and I must say after reading the story I am curious to do so.I'm also at a loss as to how the SClass scored so low. To me the embodiment of the SClass is always the  SClass so I also think they used the weong car. This is another reason why I don't put much reliance on the actual copmparisons. But the individual comments about the cars themselves are noteworthy.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                The A8, with no DNA or calliing card?HMMM? Let's see. The A8 has the best finished interior in it's class hands down and standard(across the line) AWD, not just because BMW and M-B are knocking on the door of AWD. Those are just a few of the perks that separates itself from the bigger volume cars.True, the Audi/VW connection couldn't be worse, for it's U.S. line-up anyway. VW's as of late quality and reliabilty and customer service has slipped way down. But we can't use this as an excuse. For example, take a look at Ford. With all of the troubling problems in Dearborn, one would think that the PAG would be in serious limbo. Not so the case, in fact LR keeps breaking M-2-M sales records, and Volvo has so many new products in the pipeline, especially the awesome new C70 Convertible that it seems that these companies know how to separate themselves from the gruesome NA front.But that's not to say that all of the VW-linked brands are toast. Lambo is once again having fantastic year, and need I even say Bentley, with a 3 year wait for Flying Spurs and still 1 year wait for Conti GT's and convertible on the way.Audi needs a new direction, a fresh breath of air. It may be coming sooner than we know. The R8 sports coupe is sure to spark some desire and the newly released Q5/Q7 will at least drag more suburban families in than before with only the allroad and A6 Avant to offer as utility vehicles before. They're on the right track, let's not write them off just yet.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But there are Lexuis people who have ML's and C-class cars that I know and there are plenty of MB SClass guys in my town that I see one day in the SClass and another day in a Lexus SUV or a TLC. The guys I know more closely that swapped out of MB all had a Japanese second car - either an MDX, an ES300, an LX470 or an RX. So this buyer group is hardly exclusive which makes this battle all the more ludicrous.Ray Catena - my local dealer is a big-time guy that sells both cars plus Jaguar and others. He has the biggest MB dealership in NJ (and one of the biggest in the Northeast) and his Lexus dealership just surpassed his MB dealership in sales for the first time. In fact he is opening a second Lexus dealership right next to a local MB dsealership. He couldn't care less which car you buy so long as you buy it from him.

"                you know what? i completely agree with you.  having driven the all new a8 several times, i have concluded that the Audi excells in performance, luxury, styling, quality, workmanship, and technology.  if possible, i would rewind back in time and purchase an a8 instead of theSClass.speaking of mercedes, i had the opportunity to test-drive the 2004 SClass and  SClass with the 7G-TRONIC transmission.  all i can say is ""WOW.""  this is something to be marveled at.  at first, i thought ""well what could be the difference?"" but believe me, it was so smooth that in my opinion, it is superior to that of the Lexus LexusLS transmission (which is already the smoothest one I have ever seen)  one of the things that I loathe about my '02 SClass is the 5-speed automatic, which I find extremely jerky.  also new for 2004: it looks like Mercedes has replaced the a MERCEDES-BENZ product sticker on the lower right corner of the windshield with a new one, which looks much more modern (21st century), while retaining the ""y Daimler"" signature.  a very small detail but I'm obsessed with the small details. ;-)also, I saw the new Maybach ""50-something on the showroom.  looks very impressive, and the price tag was over $350,000.  i asked how many they've sold to date: 2.something quite amusing that i feel i must add: after test-driving the SClass, i sat in a new 2004 E500 wagon.  but after asking where was the third-row seat in the back, she said:  ""you know what?  Mercedes forgot add the third row seat in the first 715EClass wagons!  when the people at the port opened the rear door, they couldn't find the rear seats!""  so there is no third row seat and instead, mercedes supplied a black plastic crate (seriously resembling those pre-school milk-carts).  i don't know how you could sit in those things (they look SO uncomfortable and small; i asume that only one person can sit in it).  for some reason, I can only imagine Mercedes for doing something like this.  i guess when the seats come in, the owners have to bring their new car back in to install them?  and finally, after thinking it over, I have decided to keep my '02 SClass until next year when the new 2005 SClass comes out. i just signed up on the wait list.  can't wait to come out, but unfortunately, it looks like the SClass won't come back...

"                you know-i just can't help but feel overwhelmed by the comfort, and power behind the wheel of a LexusLS.  plus,  with the combined features of the ultraluxury package, which brings the total MSRP under $68,000- it's a much better overall value than a stripped MB SClass or BMW 745i. to be honest with you; the lexus is seriously the only comfortable car i feel driving.  let me explain:the Mercedes-BenzSClass:a beautiful automobile, in which i  like TO BE SEEN driving, NOT DRIVING.  acceleration is quite bad, and transmission jerky.  power is not smooth at all.  the interior (of the 2000-2002 models atleast) is filled with cheap-plastic materials.  reliability is another issue; i have calculated the costs of repair for my SClass and it has totaled to approx $21,038.67 (thank goodness most of it was under warrantee).  i mean, an SClass is anSClass.  it's absolutely timeless, and is basically the best sedan you can get.  but i just don't feel relaxed/comfortable behind it.  sometimes, i think, well, i should have waited and have purchased a SClass, or evenSClassAMG.  but i have driven the SClass, and to be honest with you, i find the LexusLS to drive just a well as a SClass.  i would have gotten theSClassAMG, if not for my wife, who has threatened to divorce me (she was kidding ;-) though) if i purchased one more ""sporty-car"".  so i opted for a fully-loaded SClass instead.  big mistake.The BMW 745i/Li:to be jonest with you, i wouldn't mind at all if i had gotten the 7Series instead.  but when i test drive it, i always notice that the steering is way too loose; if i turn it a little, the car turns too much.  i therefore do not feel in control of the vehicle.  also, with the iDrive; it's a cute concept, and i like it, but after having used the MMI on the A8L, i think it is way too complicated.  i finally ""mastered"" it after spending the ENTIRE day at my childhood friend's house (he has a drop-dead gorgeous new 760Li).  but i must admit; the handling and performance truly exceed that of both the Audi and Lexus LexusLS.  i thought i was in my SL55 (though not as fast).The new 2004 A8L:it's overall, the best car (out of the Audi, BMW, and MB) that fits me well.  inside, the quality if PERFECT. i mean everywhere; take a look at the hydraullic hinge supporting the front hood.  or the materials used inside; the wood, materials...  although most people call it ""overly-conservative"" or ""boring design"", but to be honest with you guys; it's really quite beautiful; the lines are smooth, and there are no design areas that are controversial.  on the contrary, i find that the a8 has the classic lines of a traditional luxury-sedan, with a splash of modernization.  perfect balance.  this was one of the major reasons why i did not decide to purchase another lsfrom lexus; so boxy and unimginative.  but, the only reason why i am rather ""iffy"" on buying an Audi, is that i think that the name until recently was never as ""uber-sounding"" as the name 'Mercedes-Benz' 'BMW' or 'Jaguar'.  Then, it made me feel, ""hey!  if you pay ,less than $5,000 more, you can drive a Mercedes!"" or ""At the same time, I can drive a BMW flagship model.  Why not?""  But, i guess seeing is truly beleiving.  when i first saw the review @ edmunds.com, i though the a8 was as borring as ever, but after seeing it in person, I was truly impressed with Audi.  (my daughter has a Audi TT right now and i am quite pleased in terms of fit-n-finish, performance, safety, and reliability.)but then, after thinking it over, I can't help but say to myself: ""Come on... i'm driving a Mercedes-BenzSClass, essentially the most luxurious and sought-after luxury sedan on the road.  A Mercedes will always be a Mercedes.""And you know what?  Even after flipping through pages and pages of receipts from my dealership, showing problems that were fixed, issues that at first couldn't be resolved, that needed 1-3 months to be fixed, i then stare at the front of my car, then at the silver, star-i chuckle to myself, smile, and then can't help but to take the SClass out for a spin around town.

The SClass still rules the world market and is far from being the finished product like the reading on this board would lead one to believe.   Mercedes and BMW might have a problem here and there with fit every now and then, which is inexcusable, but an Audi is put together just as good as any Lexus, though per the surveys (and my experience) they won't be near as reliable.   The ES330?  Yuck, its the worst looking Lexus yet, and a complete nap-machine. Oac, Like I've said before, most of the incorrect information spewed on this board about sales, features, etc. (or anything else not pertaining to JDP/CR/WSJ) about German cars comes not from former BMW and Mercedes folk who now own Lexuses, but from Lexus-only owners.  This has been proven in your posts over and over again.  Its all surveys and charts. Bring up anything else and it doesn't matter or is over your head.  I'm still laughing at your comparison of MB and Lexi features a year or so ago, totally clueless as to the Benz features but ready to either knock them or say MB doesn't have something.

It has nothing to do with whether Touareg shoppers cross shop 4runners and Armadas.You said:""The success of the Touareg shows people are willing to spend decent dough (look the the V10's price tag) for a legitmate offering.""The Touareg is essentially a $40,000 SUV.  There are many $40,000 non-luxury name plate SUVs that sell well, such as the 4runner and the Armada. For whatever reason people are more willing to spend $40k for a non-luxury name plate SUV.On the other hand, a $70k sedan from a non-luxury name is a different story.  I don't know how it works in Europe, but in the status-minded US, a $70k VW sedan is doomed from the start, unless it is head and shoulders better than the competition, which it is not.The LexusLS is not exactly a well handling car, yet it sells like hotcakes.There is a reason why Toyota created the Lexus nameplate in the US instead of selling Celsiors (LS) and Aristos (GS) as Toyotas, like they did in Japan until very recently.

"                You said ""the 2004 lshas a Pre-safe system just like the 2003 S does.""NO IT DOESN'T.Let's see Lexus' description of their ""pre-collision system"": ""The Pre-Collision (PCS) System [2] uses radar to detect possible obstacles ahead. Sensors then determine in advance whether a crash is unavoidable. Once an accident is calculated to be inevitable, a computer immediately activates the Pre-Collision seatbelt, which restrains the driver and front passenger, and the Pre-Collision brake assist, which applies maximum braking force once the brake pedal is pressed.""Here is MBs description of their ""Pre-safe"" system: ""PRE-SAFE? helps prepare occupants for a possible collision before it occurs. If ESP and/or Brake Assist areactivated upon sensing certain vehicle dynamics that suggest an accident is possible but, according to system sensors, are not correcting the situation, PRE-SAFE snugs the front seat belts via electric tensioners, adjusts the front passenger seat (and rear seats, with 4-place seating package)2 for more favorable seat-belt and air-bag effectiveness, and (if a possible rollover is detected) closes the sunroof. If no collision occurs, PRE-SAFE reverses the front seat-belt tensioners, and occupants may re-adjust their seats and the sunroof.""By ""adjusting the front passenger seats"" what pre-safe does is to prevent submarining by lowering the rear of the drivers seat cushion while simultaneously raising the front of the driver's seat. ""Brake assist"" is also a feature of all MBs whether they have the pre-safe feature or not. Clearly the MB version is much more sophisticated and well thought out.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The A4 3.0 is no faster than anything else in its class either, and the A6 3.0 (same engine bigger car as you should know) is even worse.  The E320 will outrun either of them with an automatic.

"                You will enjoy Automobile this month despite its cover which is devoted to SUV's. There is a story about the hard to get SL55 and another one about the Quattroporte with the a8 along for a bit of comparison. After reading the latter story I can tell you I would hate the day I bought the Maserati Q if I ever were to buy one. It's really a sports car dressed up as a 4 door luxury sedan. The Audi blows it away as far as I am concerned. And you know where the Audi stands with me. The Audi also blows it away in looks - imo. This wasn't a road comparo - it was just a review of a new entrant vs an established one with luxury as the benchmark.  What is funny though is that there are 100k large sedan lux cars sold each year - give or take - and these two will only represent 6% of those sales. I'm not at all sure why the A8 sells so poorly given all that Audi puts into it (engineering wise and marketing wise - I do see plenty of A8 advertisements) as well as its competitive price. It's a great car and deserves better but the Maserati Q looks like it better be kept to a low production quota. It's a name people will aspire to, and it's a sports car people will aspire to but as a lux car it will probably disappoint (except for the fact that it's a Maserati, its different and thus will get a lot of stares) - unless you really want a 4 door sports car and not a lux car.

A while ago I nearly fell for DTS...On Q45 styling - it may use some work, of course, but what would work greatly for this car, would be slightly stretched version of the car, like Audi has slightly longer A8.  And, visually it would be more appealing.  And in general, they could make it slightly roomier inside.

"                You're right this is tiring, but what you're simply incorrect about what Lexus stated goal was.  They said point blank that the 5Series was the competitor for the GS, and that means sports sedans to people who keep up with such things.  They did so enuciate that goal.  I didn't event anything.  You're trying to frame the argument by saying things like ""out sport"" and ""flat out"" which are words I have never used anywhere here.  Of course they didn't say anything like that, no car company ever does in a press release about a new car.  Based on early sales and on winning most of the comparos against the 5, I'd say they've achieved at least some success against the goals that they actually stated as opposed to the goal that you invented for them. Sales don't mean they've built a true 5Series competitor unless you know somehow that a great deal of these sales aren't from existing Lexus customers and are instead from 5Series converts.   The car sells on its on merits, which are far from being bad, but sales don't automatically mean that the 5Series has been met on its terms. The reviews speak for themselves.  The Road and Track comparo is most telling.  They clearly state as a sports sedan contest that the 545i and M45 is where the true ""contest"" was after a few days of driving all three cars.   There is no way to rephrase what the basic outcome is in test in which sport is put first.  The 5 and M45 top the GS in that area.  Doesn't mean that the GS isn't sporty or that it is like the LS/ES.  It just isn't as sporty as the true sports sedans in its class. Have you actually driven a current 5 or GS? (I haven't.) Well I have. I actually drove the GS300, GS430 and M45 back to back.  I've driven the 545i twice since it came out.  Another reason why I say you need to drive the cars in order to get what I and the reviewers are saying.  The M45 Sport in particular is an animal when pushed.  Totally different from the GS430.  The only car we didn't drive that day was the RL.  Also, in the Car and Driver comparo didn't power come up as a compliant about the 530i?  Yep.  They clearly state that they might not being saying the same things if the V8 was present. BTW, while I accept that some may view the 5 as having better sporting qualities than the new GS, others don't seem to. All I can say is see Road and Track, June issue.  There are plenty of ""others"" that see this.  I'm not sure why you don't see what Automobile was looking for when they put the A6, GS and E in the top three spots, that to me says they weren't looking for sport first like the R&T test.  As such Automobile put the M45 and 545i near the bottom whereas R&T put them 1st and 2nd.  If that doesn't clearly prove different priorities I don't know what does. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                You're trying to use Lexus where they exist and Toyota where they don't.  Very hypocrital and very desperate to me.  If you're going to base luxury cars soley on specification, then what is the point of the ES330 being made at all compared the larger, much more powerful, same luxury interior and on and on Avalon?  I'm dying to know. Either Lexus is a luxury brand or they aren't.  Either Toyota is the pedestrian brand or they aren't. Both of them can't be both things to everyone. They can't be the same thing for the purpose of making a judgment on how popular Lexus is worldwide...when Lexus wants to distance itself from Toyota for the purpose of becoming a global luxury car player. Why do you think Lexus hasn't done squat in Europe?  They are tied to Toyota. The minute Lexus goes truly global you'll drop this absurd line of reasoning faster than Infiniti dropped the I35 to become the Japanese BMW alternative. Furthermore if you're saying that Lexus and Toyota are one in the same what the point of creating a upscale brand then?  Why not just sell them all as Toyotas worldwide?  It wouldn't work thats why. Lexus having their own design studio and engineers and distribution network for Europe is going to be wasted because they're just Toyotas?  Right. All this time you've debated with anyone here that said a Lexus was just a tarted up Toyota, now you're telling me they are one in the same?If this is the case Toyota is the polar opposite of Mercedes and BMW because unlike those brands the majority of Toyotas are Corollas, Avalons, Camrys, Tundras, Tacomas, 4Runners, Rav4s Celicas, Echos, Matrixs  and lots of other non, not even close to being luxury cars, with a few luxury cars sprinkled in like the GS, lsand SC.  The direct opposite of MB and BMW, this again by your reasoning that suggest Toyota and Lexus is one in the same. This logic couldn't be more incorrect. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                You've misinterpreted what I said. MB as a car company is the Old Gentlemen's Club. I wasn't referring to the age of the owners. Lexus as portrayed is the young upstart. I was in fact referring to the Snobbery of the MB community. You're taking the highest price of an  SClass at $90K. I don't know what % of SClass sales are 90K SClass's (Merc do you know?) but my point was, anyone paying 65K+ for a lscan afford an SClass MB (Perhaps a SClass or lower End SClass) The lsdebuted at $35K in 1990. I distinctly remember a MB VP complaining on PBS that Toyota was selling them for a $10K loss as they thought it cost $45K to build. By the time I bought mine it was $51K. (All taxes included) You'd think people might have been discouraged, as Lexus as a brand name was still very vulnerable at that point. But the rising prices didn't deter anyone. Reason? The original lswas better than the competition in the early 1990's. People paid the price, b/c it still was a bargain relatively. A purely speculative point on my part..How many Lux car buyers pay cash for their cars? (Open question to the board) I can imagine many leasing, or simply financing these days. Old timers like me prefer to pay cash, but I don't think this is universally true anymore. The Lexus dealer always points out to me in negotiation that they make more money on Leases and financing, than straight out cash transactions like mine.  Essentially the post was hitting at this point. Criticisms of Feel and design are purely Subjective. 0-60 times, Indycar handling, feel of Suspension have very little relevance to Real World driving. I sincerely doubt the majority of Lux owners race their cars where these specs might make a difference. I rarely can even hit 90+ on Massachusetts roads. These statistics are essentially Marketing fodder for the Auto equivalent of Pilot's Bull Sessions. The points of Unparalled reliablity and superior customer service ARE applicable to the Real World. I don't have time to waste waiting for a service to be completed or having to deal with irritating defects/glitches. A real world example:Ever since my 92 lswas damaged in the accident, my Lexus dealer has provided me with a Loaner and is taking care of everything..(Insurance providing OEM parts, Body Shop hassles, and ensuring everything is done to my satisifaction). They are even going to drop off the car at my convenience fully detailed. A major headache has been reduced to a minor annoyance. That's called service. I'm surprised that the MB loyalists fail to see the draw of Lexus. Lexus appeals to the affluent driver seeking a No Hassle experience. For the money I've spent on 3 lscars in 11 yrs I've got a completely hassle free experience. The US workforce boasts the highest productivity rate in the whole world, so it's no wonder many affluent buyers opt for Lexus.  I invite my Fellow lsowners to chime in on this. Do you agree with my perspective? Also, Why did you buy your LS? Cheers, SV            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                You've said that before and like before you couldn't name a single thing that Mercedes invented or came out with first, etc. that Lexus later perfected.   Keep believing that if you like, but its pure fantasy.   Lexus uses the basic building blocks laid down by Mercedes over 100 years ago just like everyone else does, they've done nothing special or different with them.  Mercedes' more complex ""stuff"" like SBC, ABC etc, Lexus has no answer for.   Yes, Lexus is showing true innovation with their Hyrbrid plans.   Even I will be impressed if they pull it off in a vehicle like a RX or LexusLS, as the Toyota Prius doesn't appeal to me. sv7887, That is the most level post I think I've ever seen from you, and I really can't take issue with any of it.    Lexus is smart, no doubt.  Ferrari did the same thing back in the day when Porsche switched to rear and mid-engined cars....Ferrari waited until Porsche perfected the concept before adopting it.   Somewhat similar to MBs and Lexus' relationship, both are great companies, but one just carries more weight with the enthusiast crowd. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                You've somehow let the others confuse you.  Where did I use ""ownership experience"" in any of MY posts?    Though since you bring up the concept, why don't you take a look at the SL500 board and see what the owners have to say.    Are you saying that every SClass has to go back to the dealer and that all MB dealers are arrogant?   If that is the case all of Cadillac's cars are junk.  Period.   Now do you want to get oriented or continue down the path of vast incorrectness?Secondly, I'm not sure why you can't understand that NOBODY is paying 60K for a Cadillac.  Do you even read the Cadillac boards here?  Cadillacs sell with huge discounts.  Now before you say it I know the XLR isn't going to be discounted like the Deville, but if you think the market is already primed for a 75K Cadillac based on the sales prices of their current cars you're wrong at best, and simply ingnoring reality at worst.   Mercedes, depending on the model either go for a few thousand off sticker: any left over 2002 (S and CL models especially), and the 2003 C andEClass cars...or they go for sticker: 2003 SClass and CL.   Even if I'm not covering every single MB market in the country you can bet nobody is getting 5-7K off a new 2003 Benz, like you can readily get off of that new DTS.    I know you know this. We do agree on the SC430 I see, though I honestly still want to ""like"" the car.    It's hard for me to dismiss a GT car, even one made by Lexus.   It's priced right and truthfully has very little competition at it's price point and Lexus knew this.  Very smart. However I think you have my position wrong on the XLR.  I would very much like the car to be a hit.  I just don't want to see the car flop simply because it was overpriced.  The XLR should be no more than 65-70K with every available option, that way it sits in between the SClass and the SCand more or less eye-level with the Jaguar.  I think a starting price of 75K and possibly over 80K with options is too much...the attitude will be ""may as well get the Benz or XKR"".  That will ensure failure for the XLR.   Price the car right intially and raise it if demand is high...thats what everyone else does (lol).   Nobody is saying there won't be ANY demand for the XLR.   How much demand is the question.   Simply put, if Cadillac doesn't bite off more than it can chew by overpricing the XLR it will be a hit.   I'm not sure who said the Hummer H2 was a waste of time.  I personally think it's a great vehicle.  Having seen just about every TV program, reading every article (including the one in CAR magazine, usually very harsh on American products) and lastly having gone to see it in the metal I think it's the best engineered vehicle GM has done in years.   The thing is purpose built, every GM engineering unit should be as motivated.  My only problem with the Cadillac trucks is that there is no where enough seperation from the Chevys they are based on.  I mean honestly what did Cadillac do other than add some leather, wood, crests, and a few other small options to make a Denali worth 60K?   A new and totally sperate interior would go a long way towards justifying the price difference. Why can't Lexus price their vehicles like MB and BMW?   Easy, Lexus has three maing things going for them Price/Reliablity/Quality.  Take away one of those by pricing the LexusLS or SC430 the same as their MB/BMW competition and they'd sell a lot less....a whole lot less.   The Japanese as a whole make the highest quality cars in the world, and they have gained the right in the market to price their cars higher than Americans or Koreans, but when it comes to German cars they still have to play the price card.   Ask Acura about NSX sales when a 911 can be had for less. Lastly, you say that everything GM does is met with skepticism.  Its not hard to see why.  The CTS is a prime example.  While it's head and shoulders above the Catera, we still have to wait until next year for the proper interior and base engine.   And you can't say it's just me and GM bashers, Lutz himself has said that car isn't up to snuff.  GM simply has a history of putting out half-baked cars, so naturally the press and foreign car enthusiasts are ""skeptical"".    This isn't as big a problem with ""regular"" cars, but when it comes to Luxury cars, reputation is everything.   Cadillac is going to have to do a string of cars ""right"" before their image turns around.  Audi did it with one hit after another, 1996 A4, 1997 A8, 1998 A6, and back again with the 2002 A4.  None of Audi's cars were ""works in progress"" upon their release like the CTS is.   GM simply has to stop it. ljflx, ""Lexus doesn't care about the enthusiasts - it cares about its target market. ""Wow, you said a mouthful my friend.  I guess thats why the IS300 hasn't been a hit huh.

I've written Mercedes about that 1K special order charge, I think it needs to be done away with.   I'm willing to bet that Lexus will build the HPX.  It's the perfect compliment to the RX300 and a exact competitor to the upcoming Mercedes R-Class (GST).   A new large lux-crossover segment is emerging I think. syswei, You're right Lexus shouldn't try to do the model layout like the Germans do, but at the very least they need one tuner product based on the next GS.  AWD would definitely be a welcome addition to the GS and lslines, as would another engine option for the lsand SCmodels. That would go a long way towards acceptance in the higher-end segments. bluestar1,One thing...the next GS is going to need far more than 350hp if it wants to be a BMW killer, that is if you're talking about going after the next M5 (500hp).  Now if you're talking about a 545i Sport competitor then such a GS would be just the right car. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Your point about how to count cars doesn't piss me off at all nor do I think it would bother many. It's simply a ridiculous way of looking at things. You have this strange theory that a car can only count if it has some weird purity that you believe in. The fact that an ES330 is only 25% Camry as sv7887 pointed out so often is something you just don't get. But let's look at the real world. How many Camry's do you think the ES330 canibalizes every yearn or vice versa? You may not even need two hands to count them. You may not even need a finger. You know why, none of its buyers consider it the way you do and its a car that hits its mark perfectly. Now ask how many competitor sales the ES330 is canibalizing because it's cannibalizing 75k of some lux brands cars every year. The fact that A GX470 has a totally different feel, look and lux presence and fabulous ride that makes you think it's a lux car rather than an SUV vs. a 4-runners pure truck feel is lost on you. The fact that the LX470 was raised to a height that made it the ultimate lux SUV and cannibalized Range Rover sales and more than doubled what TLC's normal annual sales in the US had been is also lost on you. The fact that the RX is an original vehicle is somehow lost on you.  What is funniest and strangest of all is you also discount a vehicle like the TLC because it had a Toyota badge even though historically it is a legendary, expensive SUV viewed as the best or one of the best SUV's ever made and one that is far removed from Toyota's normal prices to begin with. In your view a business can't take advantage of its' existing assets. That's a nice way of saying let me make as little money as I can. So you can make the argument you do but I think other than some diehard German car fans you won't find many people who think as you do. That's why it won't bother anyone. Success has a way of easily disproving that these type of thoughts are nothing but someone's fancy.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"                You mean to honestly tell me you can't see where syswei is pointing to Lexus' entire product line as the main factor as to why Lexus' sales are so high?   My only point about that is that their entire product line doesn't sell like all the hype in here would suggest it does.  He acts like every Lexus model is a star seller like the LexusES or RX, and it simply isn't true. Seriously, all these facts go right past you?  If you can't understand that a much higher set of sticker prices would hinder #1 sales status then you're not dealing in reality.  There is no way the brand with highest sticker prices can be a bestseller in todays market.   When they did accomplish this it was the introductory year for the CLK and M-Class, two models that were arguably cheaper , especially the ML, than most (not all) other Mercedes' at the time.   And ironically it was the ML (an SUV) that did most of that sales growth, proving once again this the hottest segment and what drives you know who's sales machine. You're saying that other automakers need to address their weaknesses in order to compete with Lexus, like Lexus has no weaknesses.  Hopefully for Lexus they aren't thinking that way about the GS and IS.  This was all brought about by two things.  The implied notion that Mercedes' cars weren't good enough to sell better, forgetting that that cost more.  Secondly, that Lexus cars are better so they sell more, when in fact they don't sell more cars.  They do sell more vehicles total, because they do sell a better collection of SUVs, but going by the first point it would seem the implication is that Mercedes' cars are better, at least going by syswei's more sales = better car theory.   Since this theory is based on the assumption that everyone who bought a Lexus looked at a Mercedes and decided on the Lexus. It's amazing that I'm often accused of not able to see anything good about Lexus, but I do give Lexus it's just credits on  reliability, quality, service etc.  Yet the fact that Mercedes sells it's more expensive cars at an equal or most often better rate than Lexus does, it says nothing about their market presence or penetration and is lost on everyone...and therefore means nothing. Boy if Lexus had a more expensive car than a Mercedes that sold better, you'd never hear the end of it! M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If resale value is important to you, these are the cars likely to depreciate the least during the ownership period. Below we show the percentage of its original value that each vehicle is likely to retain after five years with an annual mileage of 15,000. Keep in mind that the residual value percentages are based on the national True Market Value? (TMV) price, plus typical options and destination charge. A quick scan of our list shows that import nameplates rule when it comes to retaining their value, Viper and Corvette excepted.

"                Cool little chart that you've made up. Toyota, and especially Honda, are known for making gobs of power out very small displacement/liter motors. BUT: There is one huge drawback to this. These engines are usually down on torque numbers. Take for instance the wonderful Acura RL. With 300hp coming out of only a 3.5L V-6, the engine is free revving , but you do have to stab at the throttle quite a bit to stay in the powerband in the twisties. Toyota's/Lexus new family 3.5L V-6 on the other hand, is a fiesty little marvel of engineering. With over 300hp in IS form, this thing is powerful off the line and while hustling corners, much easier to modulate than the Honda engines.So yes, the compact engines do have plenty of advantages. They're usually lighter, have more technology bestowed in them, and are very happy in the rev range. But the big-bore MB motors are a hoot to drive. These engines get more and more American-like with every iteration, in terms of sound and raw power. P.S.- As for BMW, squeezing 360-hp out of only 4.8L is a huge accomplishment itself. And with Audi bumping hp numbers up to 365hp with the '07 A8's 4.2L engine(thanks to a switch to direct injection among other things), this hi-po compact engine craze is on the rise.

"  1. Wrong, Lexus and Toyota doesn't make anything that can compete with an AMG in performance so they are certainly not best in that category. In selling lots of boring reliable luxury cars they probably are the best.  AMG is irrelevent to 90% of buyers of new MB's, even less relevent to buyers of decade-old MB's.   2. S is way more expensive than the lsso naturally you are going to see more. You missed the point entirely.  I have seen more than a couple brand new SClass broken down by the road side waiting for emergency help near where I live; never an LexusLS.  Since there are more lsthan SClass on the road, makes you wonder just how big the quality difference is.  3.  Isn't it interesting how they used Mercedesque taillights though, lol. But the styling on the rest of the car is pretty uninspired. What is?  MB invents taillights now?  Have you seen how much the new M class copies from the RX? 4. Wrong again on the AMG's. AMG's come with the same equipment as the regular models but with a world class hand made engine, and upgraded suspensions, brakes, wheels and some cosmetic interior changes. Wrong on what??  AMG variants come out a couple years after the standard model, so it's not exactly the leader of latest technology, is it? 5. Disagree, those old SL's are pretty sweet. And I would love to have a 190 EVO  Feel free to live in the past.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"  1.LOL no anger here, I really do laugh. I find it funny when people praise Lexus like they are the greatest cars ever made. Some of them indeed are.  Car making as a technology has been advancing for the last 120 years.  The greatest car made today are indeed the greatest car ever made.  Why is that surprising?  2. The S is the standard of the class. I will probably never get one but what it does it is the best in its class and that's nothing to be ashamed about. Complete nonsense.  I have seen more than a couple stranded brand newSClasses by the side of the road near where I live but never an LexusLS.  There are more lsthan S in my neck of words.  In any case, since you are never going to get one, probably never even driven one, how in the world do you know it is the best in its class?  Personally, I like the ride quality of lsmuch better than S.  I was sitting in a 2005 Rolls Phantom yesterday (at a party thrown by the magazine that I bought ads from, and a limo company brought the car for drumming up its business), and even that car offers nothing substantially superior to the lsas far as interior appointment is concerned.   BTW, I cringed at the thought of the V12 idling the entire 5 hrs that I was there; such is the fate of 450 horses trapped in a posure mobile.  If it were not for the day getting dark and my unfamiliarity with the beach town, I would have offered him a couple hundred bucks to let me drive the thing a couple blocks :-)  He did promise to make the vehicle available for $1200 if I ever need it in Boston, and he will have it driven up to me from NYC for only $100 extra.  There's hope yet :-)  3. Passion and soul are certainly not objective quantities but if you don't believe me check with just about every automotive journalist seems to say the same thing about Lexus when they review the cars (boring tomb like etc.)  By age 34, one should have learned that journalists are probably one of the least reliable sources of information, especially on subjective items.  Also, not even they consider all Lexus cars boring tomb like; e.g. the current IS300.   4. LOL again with the S. class, and the pinnacle of Mercedes engineering is AMG and any of those models, even your hated SClass will blow the doors off the Lexus. (The S65 will do 0-60 in 4.2 seconds.) Some chauffeur car huh. And I love the G-class. A world renown offroading vehicle. And the G-55 AMG sweet! AMG is a mod shop (whether when it was independent or bought out by MB).  The have the last dip on car models that are already at least a couple years old.  The SClass is where Mercedes introduce all the new stuff.  5. And comfort and convenience are the hallmarks of a good luxury car but in my opinion it also must be fun to drive and it must look good too, which Lexus isn't. Some Lexus models are, some are not.  Mercedes was neither fun to drive nor good to look at when it was at the top of its game a couple decades ago.  The adjectives used for Mercedes back then were ""ponderous,"" ""aurthoritive"" and ""prestigeous""; hardly the stuff for ""fun to drive.""  The looks did not change for decades when Mercedes were doing well.  The usual rule of thumb in the automobile industry is that when a company has to rely on looks to sell cars, its' years are numbered.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                Your second paragraph of post #3475 raises some interesting points.  Yes Mercedes has more models than ever before, but that isn't the main reason for their quality decline, cost cutting is.   Some of which may or may not be linked to having to absorb losses at Chrysler.   This sheer depth of models means there is always something new to try, so a  many a MB buyer (not all) will stay with MB until they sort out their issues.   This has been witnessed right here on this very board.  A LexusLS or SC430 buyer doesn't have any other choice after that but to get another lsor SC, which I'm sure is fine for many, not saying it isn't...just trying to make the point about product...not desirability.  Toyota's Lexus on the other hand has been very conservative with their lineup when it comes to additions.  They only new segment they've entered is the sport sedan segment with the IS300, and it hasn't been a success.   Lexus' best products are the LexusLS, LexusES, their SUVs and the SC430.  The difference between Lexus and Mercedes is that Lexus' sales dominance is based on somewhere around 50 percent of those sales being based on SUVs.  Mercedes' sales aren't dependent on any one model as they all are top sellers in their respective segments. If Mercedes is spread too thin, Lexus is just the opposite....no variety.  I wouldn't want to be that dependent on one particular segment (SUV) of the market.  Mercedes is only doing what they've always done, many versions of the same car.  BMW and Audi do the same thing, they just don't have as many models (like the CLK, CL, SL) to do it with.  You should see all the C, E and SClass variants that we don't get here.  Euro makers have always done this, it's nothing new.   For years Mercedes' most loyal customers asked for more variants, and just looking the sales numbers it was justified.  Look for BMW (6-Series, X3, 1Series, possible X7) to do the same thing in just about a year or so. "" How many muscle cars does the market need ?""None.  It's not about ""need"" its about want, lust, desire, but definitely not need.   Everyone has a tuner product nowadays, its all the rage, similar to the SUV thing.  Even Volvo has a 300hp S60R, with an adjustable suspension that has one mode only suitable for the track.  This is from Volvo!  ljflx, You see my point..yikes!

BTW, we don't get SWBSClasses here and the RL and 745i, give me a break. You'd have had your break if you had noticed the past tense in my previous post.  The RL was designed for 1996 model year, and hasn't had much updating.  Let's see, what MB and BMW had in 1996 for 7Series and SClass base models: S320SWB for NA market, S280 for the rest of the world; 740 for the NA market, 735/728 for the rest of the world.  Like I said, RL was once-upon-a-time semi-competitive with MB S and BMW 7 when it was introduced.  Every single criticism you worked up against RL applies to MB of the mid-90's too.  Mainstream MB cars were always ""heavy tanks""; even the SClass of that era faired poorly in latter crash tests (contemporaries were not as obsessed with barrier crash tests as we are now).   There is a difference between barrier crash tests vs. real life crashworhiness against another car of average weight (not the a heavy car's own weight as the barrier tests imply). Heck no it isn't and the difference isn't worth the price over the TL! They should have given the RL a modern transmission first. By the same token, heck no, E320 isn't worth the price over the TL!  They should have given the E320 a modern engine first.   I like how you try to cover the out-dated engine issue with an excuse about its being upgraded for 2006.  Do you realize that RL is getting an upgrade even before 2006?Like I said, E320 is out-dated in its competitive market segment, just like RL is in its own.  The big difference is that RL is a marginal part of Acura's market, whereas E320 is the mainstay of MB's sales (given that the ML320 completely lost its market segment to RX300/330).   Now I know the GS300 doesn't sell now because it is simply old and due for a redesign, but you didn't exactly state that. That's implied to be common knowledge, no specific mention necessary.  GS300 was introduced before RX300, yet the latter got a complete redesign three years before the GS300 despite the latter's fabulous sales throughout its life cycle.  That should tell you where Lexus' priority is.  When Lexus put out the new SC430, it didn't even bother making an SC300 version.  Lexus has the meat of the entry-mid luxury market taken care of with the ES300/330 and RX300/330.  MB's offerings in that segment, the E320, E320 wagon and ML320/350 have been losing sales to Lexus in dramatic fashion.  That is MB's biggest problem.  It's holding tenuously onto the relative small ""somewhat sporting"" corner of the entry-mid luxury, with what's left over by BMW 3Series /530i (and Acura TL at somewhat lower price point); it's not a big slice of the pie to begin with, especially with BMW's dominance in that corner.   With GS300 redesign coming soon, MB is in even bigger trouble.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"  I guess then it will matter because the car will be a hybrid right? It will be yet another battle in a different segment.  Lexus strategy seems to be stepping into a market, transform itself from a new comer to a market leader by focusing on the meat of the market; then rinse and repeat for the sub-segment that it did not touch previously.  S8/AMG sales don't matter much in the context of regular A8, S, and lssales; it does matter in an S8 vs. AMG competition, to be joined later with whatever Lexus bothers to offer, bankrolled by its lssales.

"  All spin and bs not really worth responding to. The IS and GS you say - ""were performance extensions of LexusES and RX mainstream cars"". Dude that is so ridiculous it doesn't warrant a response. Totally ridiculous. Posting a content-free response like that, and you call my post ""spin and bs""??  What exactly is MB and BMW's competitor to ES330 if it is not 325i, 525i, C240/280 and E320?  Those account for the bulk of 3/5/C/E sales just like LexusES and RX accounting for the bulk of entry-price and mid-size sedan and wagon sales for Lexus. Bull, plain and simple. AMG goes back to 1967 and BMW's M wasn't even a matter of discussion back then.AMG as an independent shop was a very different animal from AMG under MB ownership.  AMG as an independent shop was little different from Brabus from a marketting point of view . . . as you can see, nobody really cares about what Brabus offers in the last few thousand posts.  MB's acquisition of AMG was a direct response to BMW M's success.  Adding horsepower and adding torque is nothing more than what carmakers do since the late 19th century; at least adding electronics was new since the 1960's.  All this talk about Lexus copying others are just old claptrap nonsense from sore losers.  Carmakers copy from each other all the time, since the day the wheel was invented.  Lexus does not set out to copy leaders; they learn the success of leaders, and set out to overtake leadership.  That's something MB is really terrible at.  Look at MB's R class, 203"" vehicle length but only 82 cu.ft interior space.  Apparently the company does not even deign to learn from its own Chrysler division.  Ironicly, it was a famous German (Otto von Bismarck) once said that, ""only fools learn from their own mistakes . . . smart people learn from those of others.""  Lexus learn from others whereas MB is bent on relearning everything at its own expense.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"  And since when is it a surprise to see the Toyota/Lexus connection when it comes to styling? The photos provided by Merc1 are more evidence. They should not be a surprise to anyone. I can agree that the current Camry and current LexusES share many styling cues.  However, the ""evidence"" shown by M regarding the rear ends of 07 Camry and LS460?  They are only similar in the sense that they are both 3-box sedans without circular tail lights.  That's about it.  There are only so many elements in rear end design: rear light stack shape, trunk shape/proportion, license plate recess shape/proportion, chrome strip, position of center/high-mount brake light, antenna choice, bumper shape and outline, and where/how roofline meets the belt line.  That's about it if you are not interested in turning your sedan into a wagon or hatchback.  Not a single design element in that list are similar for 07 Camry and LS460!On the other hand, if you look at the rear ends of E vs. Accord, triangular tail light assemblies, size and shape of center-mount brake lights, license plate recess and chrome strip, trunk lid shape etc. are all the same!

"  I've used R&T and Automobile to make my points, not just C&D. PLus, Merc, the Lexus lshas won more than one comparo! The previous generation beat all comers, including the S, as well! You never seem to get this Doc, but the LexusLS only beat the SClass not the  SClass which is what Motor Trend put over the LexusLS back in 2001.  This about the lshaving beat the ""S-Class"" really isn't accurate because the lshasn't beat the entire range of SClass cars, only theSClass.  I have seen where the  SClass beat the LexusLS back in 2001 in MT so it isn't a cut-n-dry as you'd like to incorrectly blur it here.  Also Motor Trend put the A8 over the LexusLS much more recently. The lsis a better car than the Germans, if things like interior, drivetrain, smoothness, fit and finish, braking, ride, seating, features, acceleration, price means anything. Only by certain comparos, it isn't unaminous. As I've stated long before this discussion, C&D has the most well-thought out, balanced comparisons. They don't over-value sports car moves, they always have a scorecard so it isn't too subjective to find a winner, and they back up their objective results with logical conclusions. As I've stated before you only use the comparos that put Lexus on top and saying that the rest don't know what they're talking about is just plain nonsense.  Now when the others put the lsfirst, which they have sometimes you'll use them, but when they don't you knock their criteria.  That is the oldest crybaby excuse in the book Doc.   Is that the best you can do? So you admit the SClass has been an ""also-ran"" for years? Out on vacation with a whimper! Nope, back unfortunately to read the same Lexus rantings. What you don't see here is that the SClass is still the world's benchmark and was just recently surpased in the later years of its (W220) life, unlike the SC430 which was a loser and a dullard from day one.  It has never been the benchmark and has had its windshield handed to it from the time it came to market.  Again the  SClass beat the LexusLS back when both cars were relatively new in a MT comparo.  The SC430 has never, ever beat the SL.  Ever.  Period.  Big difference. That very same C&D comparison had the lsdead last in objective dynamic handling numbers! Fortunately, C&D doesn't say if it is a class-best handler, the car has no value, like you do. Again, I thought we had settled this about the ls's handling. I don't count the car out because it doesn't have handling as good as the German cars in the class and I think you and I settled this with your addmission that the LexusLS didn't handle as well as the German cars here?  The only reason I went on with that is because of the absurd notion from other Lexicans about how the LexusLS would handle if it had this and if it had that.  The problem is that die-hard Lexus fans can't admit anything and will tell you that anything the lscan't do best doesn't matter which is why this about the lsand its handling was about the most rediculous conversation going.  Anyone who knows anything about handling wouldn't even mention the term in the same sentence with the LexusLS and this about a what if is just a big fat excuse for the exhausted Lexusfans who can't accept anything else.

"  I wasn't pointing to the GS as a trend, silly. I pointed out that even excluding SUVs, Lexus' sales are up 45% in 6 years, vs 20% for MB, and you brought up the GS in an attempt to explain away Lexus' performance. I just pointed out that MB has been helped slightly more by the CLS and SLK than Lexus has been helped by the GS. You can forget about the GS/CLS/SLK line of discussion, and just focus on 45% vs 20%. Well your post read like and gave numbers for the current year, so that is what I thought you were talking about.   You'll have to produce the numbers for the last 6 years with SUV sales in order for me to believe that one.  That would mean they're selling a lot of LexusES and lsmodels because both the IS and GS have never been that popular.   Even if they are up that much on the car side, you'll turn around and say price has nothing to do with it, though nearly every Lexus car model is cheaper than every MB car model.

"  Its bcos contrary to the perception being thrown out here, its actually the Germancarfans that constantly harp on RELIABILITY..... How many Lexophiles point out reliability, relative to how many Germancarfans do ?I can't believe what I'm reading.  Reliability has been the selling point of the Lexus since day one on this board. Lexusguy just spoke on reliability of his 2 lsvehicles.  If anything Germancarfans mention this because that is all we hear from camp Lexus, reliability and sales.  These are thrown up anytime a hole is found in the Lexus armor.  Whether it be styling, performance, safety, lack of technology, we see ""but they're selling and they're reliable"".  You've got to be kidding if you don't see this OAC.  You just hinted about reliability in regards to my post about MB and electronics.  Hilarious!  :P In the same vein, pls reduce the worn-out ""performance"" issue of the S vs the LexusLS. As many of you have agreed, most HELM buyers are not concerned with skidpads or slalom numbers, so why harp on it ? Nope, because performance is as part of the Germancar vernacular as reliablity is a part of the Lexus vernacular.  True most buyers aren't going to race or slalom these cars, but at the same time real buyers right here that have owned both cars can tell you the difference and that difference is partially what draws certain buyers to German cars in the same way the promise of supreme reliability draws Lexus buyers in and keeps them.  This about the lsand its performance being equal in your mind is because you're simply looking at 0-60 time and a bunch of numbers while being completely oblivous as to how these cars go about putting up these numbers is most telling - you don't understand what is meant by performance.  Think of this way: A CLS55 AMG (you saw the video right?) can put the same or nearly identical numbers in most performance tests as a BMW M5 or a  SClass can do the same against a 750Li in certain areas, but the BMWs are better at doing it.  They don't roll (lean) as much, their brake pedals are firmer, steering firmer, better feeling etc. etc.  This is why the more powerful IS350 can't cut it against the weaker 3Series . On paper the IS350 destroys the 3Series , but in the real world the control and poise isn't there.  Regardless if the IS350 can put up the same braking or slalom numbers and outright stomp the 3Series  in a straight line it doesn't ""outperform"" by the definition of performance used by Germancarfans.   The lsis the same way compared to a S/A8/7Series in that order.  Lastly for this post this about the lsand the SClass is a highly-inaccurate.  The LexusLS has never beaten the SClass as a whole, only theSClass.  A LexusLS has never beaten a  SClass and the one time they did meet in a U.S. magazine back when the lsfirst came out, MT put the  SClass over the LexusLS. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"  keep in mind that the A8 in either long or short wheelbase is AWD and I'm sure that will affect the quickness of the vehicle. For the same engine and same vehicle weight, AWD should be slightly quicker, especially for cars that have enough power to spin rear wheels. as for which automobile is safer i am sure they are both equally safe in accidents regardless of the steel vs aluminum nonsense that has been filling this thread. How can you be sure??  Based on what??  There are all sorts of accidents, most of which do not involve composite barriers and most are not at 40mph.  They may both score similarly in crash tests; there is much more to safety than crash tests.  One thing we do know for sure is that, in a fender bender, aluminum bodies are much much more expensive to repair.  Another set of facts that we do know for sure is that: aluminum has lower melting and flaming points, so in case of severe accidents with fire . . .; no simiulated standard crash tests ever involve fire.

"  Maybe the S handles a better than the LexusLS. I would put the 7 at the top of the class.Yep it does and the 7 is.

Does that make the lsan inferior ride to theSClass, not to me, and not to lsowners. Lexus is building the car to the market, the US, where ride quality is more important than handling. Apparently it does for some, you know the group that buysSClasses, 7Series and A8s.  That would be true if the lscosts the same as the other cars it compete with, but as it stands you don't know which is more important with the lsselling for thousands upon thousands less money which is a major part of its success.  Some have actually said that the SClass rides better than the lsanyway so that statement really doesn't hold water.  The almighty Consumer Reports (a Lexican favorite) preferred the ride of the S to the lsI believe. Discrediting the Euro suspension because you can't find it, or comparing Lexus to Buick is where sour Grapes of Wrath appear. No, it points out how pointless this option is because Lexus lsbuyers don't know anything (or care) about handling.

For example, everytime i stop at traffic lights i will see either corollas or civics. For some occassion, i even saw 3 or 4 civics at once. Therefore, even the car with greatest style in the world will look bland after millions driving in one.Nah a good looking car looks good no matter how many times you see it.  VWs are plentiful too and the Passat in particular is still a very good looking.  Where I live on a good Saturday you'll see more Mercedes/BMW/Lexus than you could count and the story is always the same, German lookers and Japanese blanders.  What I find really interesting about Lexus is that their chief has shot his mouth off about this new look and so far the car have only come out looking worse, especially the GS.  Now the new IS does hold promise.  It has the small tight, lithe look of the best European cars, at least in pics. One element of good styling is the way the sheetmetal appears to be stretched over the chassis just enough to cover the wheels.  Another is no space in the wheel wells.  Look at an Audi to see what I mean here.  This is one reason why the 7Series BMW is so ugly, their is too much space in the wheel wells. Ditto for the 5Series which depends greatly on color and wheel size to look good. The Japanese are getting better at this, but in the past Nissan and Toyota were terrible with this.  Any Maxima up until the 2004 model looked like it had an air suspension locked in the highest postion possible.   Acres of space between the tire and the body.

Lexus sells around 3300 LexusLS and LX470 alone each month; add almost all of the 2800 or so GX470 which are usually priced over $50k when popular options are added; the a small per centage of fully loaded  RX 's, which has a huge base number to work with, like 9-10k units, even if only 10% of them are fully loaded, that's another 1k units.

Hardly ramblings...You still haven't addressed the fact: How is it that Lexus sells for LESS and still makes more profit on the LexusLS vs MB on theSClass. Let me try this one more time. What do quarterly earning reports and pricing strategy have to do with anything? Why should anyone care that Lexus makes more profits on the LexusLS than MB on theSClass? Regardless of the fact that you haven&#146;t provided any figures to backup this claim, I&#146;m not sure what the purpose of this argument is.   Merc is correct to say that MOST consumers of these cars probably don't consider profits..But I doubt they also care who was first to market the airbag or whatever.  You&#146;re right; most people probably don&#146;t care because most people are uniformed about safety when they shop for a car? otherwise the Chevy Cavalier wouldn&#146;t sell. The fact of the matter is innovation, whether it be safety, performance or hybrid innovation, reflects the values and priorities of the companies that sell cars. With Mercedes it is obvious that safety is a high priority, as we can see through their innovation and class leading standard features. With Lexus, cost cutting is obviously a high priority.   What facts? Least safety conscious? If so, they would do poorly in ALL safety tests. I looked at those links for the crash results..You pretty much confirmed what I thought..The lsgot the highest rating and in fact was recommended for frontal collisions!!!! The RX and GS were marked down to Average in one category..This is hardly a basis to judge a car ""unsafe"" or ""Shoddy engineering.."" The previous lsdid receive the highest rating, but not all &#147;best picks&#148; are created alike. Both the previous 5Series andEClass scored higher &#147;best picks&#148; than the LexusLS. The RX was marked down the first time due to a weak structure/safety cage and the second time because the dummy &#147;bottomed out the airbag.&#148; The BMW X5 on the other hand, was rated the &#147;safest SUV ever tested.&#148; So basically 90% of the time the lswill hold up as well as the competitors. (In the frontal types of crashes) In the 10% where it may not perform as well the injuries usually aren't serious to begin with...This sounds like a marginal advantage at best... You can&#146;t assume that all cars that scored similarly in the IIHS test offer similar protection in real world accidents or even within the IIHS scoring system. The IIHS tests are an instance in which Lexus scored well in is ONE relatively low speed designer test that most manufacturers prepare for before hand. This and other tests cannot account for the infinite number of crashes that occur in real life that manufacturers aren&#146;t held accountable for in the form of standardized tests. What would happen if you increased the impact speed from 40mph to 50mph? Or reduced the overlap from 40% to 30%? What would happen in a rollover or shallow angle side impact? Would Lexus still hold up, or would Lexus&#146; disregard for safety be exposed once the predictable crash tests are removed? I would submit to you that MB and others have the upper hand in this regard. Also, these tests do not account for safety features not found in Lexus automobiles like rear side airbags. Yes, the NHTSA (and sometimes IIHS) conduct side impacts and rate both front and rear passengers, but the forces are more concentrated on the driver because the vehicle is struck towards the front. Also, crash tests don&#146;t account for the safety benefits of things like rear seatbelt ETDs, roll bars, fuel shutoff, battery disconnect, etc. Why don't you list the countless times Toyota has had bad crash results...Here are 9 examples: Looks like Toyota puts safety at the top of its priority list judging by all these chart toping performances : / http://www.iihs.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/96022.htmhttp://www.iihs.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/98014.htmhttp://www.iihs.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/98003.htmhttp://www.iihs.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/95031.htmhttp://www.iihs.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/97023.htmhttp://www.iihs.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/95007.htmhttp://www.iihs.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/97022.htmhttp://www.iihs.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/96005.htmhttp://www.iihs.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/0106.htmNow how is it unfair that the SClass is compared to the LS? Using your logic, the SClass should be a fair comparison because it is priced higher. Yet the LexusLS still beat it anyway. Someone already pointed out they didn't test the Euro Sport model. I read that comparo recently and said it was like comparing a person on slippery ballerina shoes to normal ones..Even THEY admit it wasn't fair..So what are you going to argue now???Nothing was unfair about this coparison in regards to Lexus, nor did C&D ever admit to that. It isn't anyone's fault except Lexus' that the standard ""Japanese Sport"" suspension is far inferior to that of the European competition. I really can&#146;t fathom why the LexusLS won the comparison; C&D must be accepting &#147;donations&#148; from car companies these days. Even with the Euro Sport suspension, the lswill never be as athletic as the 7 or the S. Even the most diehard lsfan should be able to admit that. The LexusLS lost in all performance aspects except acceleration, has rip-off exterior styling, an interior pulled from the Camry, and fewer features than the competition. Given that all cars at this level offer roughly the same level of luxury, the lshas no real advantage except price and reliability? sounds like C&D needs to change its name to Consumer Reports? apparently driving dynamics carry little weight with a magazine concerned foremost with performance.

"  You kind of sidestepped the question: Are Toyota Camry, Cadillac Escalade, Mitsubishi Eclipse, Ford Exploder, etc., ""losers""? These cars, minus the Cadillac aren't luxury vehicles and the standard (to me) is somewhat different, they're about sales more so than a 60K Lexus.  The previous Cadillac Escalade was a loser IMO.  It sold well, but that was about all it did.  It drove like crap, and had an interior to die about, not for. When it comes to luxury vehicle I think sales are important, but they aren't as important to what the car brings to the market, which makes a car like the lsa winner, but the SC430 a loser IMO.

" ...the silly comments about Lexus being upscale Buick make you look bad. if it was that easy GM would have upgraded Buick or Cadillac a long time ago..LJ, if that's your best defense, then we may as well not even play the game. It's easily known that the average blue-haired customers shop both Lexus,Buick, and Caddy. And that thing about upgrading Caddy, hmmm.. As it stands of now, Caddy's lineup makes Lexus look ""bad"". The CTS(especially the V) continues to be successful, and the glorified Escalade runs circles around the LX in terms of technology and sales(for the same money interestingly), and the STS V8 is a better performer than the GS430(dare I even mention the STS-v?).

"  The LexusLS outselling theSClass, is in part due to a price advantage. I mean take away everything else and you have a car that starts at 57K going against what was until April (S350 is entry level now) of this year a 77K car in theSClass. All I'm saying is that has to account for something. How much so I don't know, but to say it doesn't matter is false. I'm not sure what you are trying to say. . . that being an inefficient manufacturer somehow is an excuse for not selling well?   The V6 SClass took a five year hiatus; there was a '99 S320.  I just don't get it, LexusLS offers more luxury and more performance than SClass at a lower price point, somehow this excuse MB from being non-competitive? While the ES330 is an entry-level luxury car, its mission and focus isn't really in tune with any other European or Japanese luxury car company's entry level products. In short, no one else is chasing the LexusES or even considers it a competitor, at least not enough of one to warrant producing such a uninvolving car. That's patentedly false.  Every manufacturer would love to have a midsize car in their lineup that can sell 100k units at $10k profit each.  I30 was killed in competition; TL had to become more sporting to compete; S60/80/V70, 9-5 and A6 sell on being different (ie. accept much smaller market shares) and have wagon offerings.   All these cars, plus  EClass , used to occupy the LexusES market niche.  LexusES simply cleaned their clock in the standard luxury sedan market, and they all have to find some theme to survive (and/or accept much smaller market shares).  There are plenty mid-size car models made by the Europeans that are even less sporting than ES330; many of them are not even bothered to be brought over here simply because the LexusES dominance of the market.  Don't tell me MB would not bring the sluggard E220 here if it could sell well in the face of ES330.   The IS and GS, where MB and Lexus are more of direct competitors,Not true at all.

" ""Do you think that if Mercedes went back to their former style that Lexus ""copied"" they would sell a lot more cars.""I'm not sure actually.  I think design wise they've never been better with the exception of the CLK and Maybach.  Neither of those cars ""look"" like they should imo.  I also think the SClass could stand a few less frivolous details like on the sides and hood, but overall Mercedes seems to be at the top of their game design wise.   This statement is pending me actually seeing the CLS mind you.   Their old style probably wouldn't sell today unless they brought back everything that went along with those designs.  You know like the hefty build and much better reliability, you know the stuff that made the legend in the first place.    For them to just go back to stodgy designs without the corresponding jump in quality wouldn't work, again imo.  If they did both then heck yeah it would work, but they'd sell a lot less cars.   Good question. Also, if people buying Lexuses think that they are the ultimate then people buying MB, BMW and others think those brands are the ultimates also.   Overall image still goes to the Germans, no matter how slight or fleeting that advantage may be to Lexus owners.  Until Lexus does some, what I like to call gee-whiz cars and a 100K+ car they simply don't have the image here and especially on the worldwide scene. oac,?You're confused about Mercedes-Benz's models.   The ""C-Class"" does not comprise the CLK or CL.  The CLK is a 50K+ machine and the CL is a 100K+.  The CLK is based on the C-Class sedan chassis, but its sales aren't counted in with the C-Class.  The CL is a large coupe based on theSClass, it has nothing to do with the C-Class at all.   If you think the 50K+ CLK Coupe/Convertible and 100K and up CL Coupe are supposed to even contend with a 33K ES330 Sedan (in the heart of the market) for sales you're completely lost on how the market works. The SClass being down on sales means what?   The car came out in the Spring of 1999 as MY2000 car and is now the oldest car in this class.   It had a record year in 2000 and in 2003, which were its introduction and face-lift years.   The lshas and will do the same thing for 2001 and 2004.  These are normal market trends, yet you continue to hype this as type of abnormality or crisis.   The Lexus GS has literally fallen of the sales charts for the same reasons, it's old.   Is that a crisis or just a normal model progression over time? Lexus sales more cars because they have a cheaper overall lineup.  I don't know why this has been so hard to grasp on this board.   Lexus' core cars are between 33-55K, and they are the LexusES, RX, GS, IS and GX.   This same price spread will only get you a C-Class, CLK320, M-Class, SLK or E320 at a Mercedes-Benz store.   It is so obvious that you haven't ever looked at 1) a MB sales chart or 2) the price configurator at the MB site.   They have 25 models that start around 50K (E320 48K) and up, compared to 12 that are priced under 50K.  The sales advantage will likely always be Lexus'. That plus the fact that Lexus has the most efficient dealership setup in the industry (which is Lexus' competitor's problem, not Lexus') equals more sales.  I've always stated the Lexus had the greatest dealership setup.  Mercedes, BMW, Audi, and Jaguar have had some of the same dealers for 40 years and it is hard to get such and entrenched group (read stubborn) to change their ways.   Mercedes actually lost about 80 dealerships in the late eighties and early nineties when sales hit an all time low of about 60K units in 1993.  In Southern Cal there are way too many dealerships in some cases right on top of each other and for years they've all been able to sell enough cars to make each one of them viable.  Same situation Florida.  Huge markets.  I bet Lexus has far fewer dealerships in these areas, but no doubt sells more cars though each one. All this crisis talk based on sales is so ridiculously funny because in 1993 Mercedes sold a little over 61K cars and they had way more dealers then, but now they move over 200K a year.  You Lexus guys missed the real crisis as far as sales are concerned! Also..the new SLK will make a huge difference once it goes on sale.  The SLK will be in the 40-50K range and is set to dominate the class until the next Porsche Boxster comes along, going by the press reviews so far.  Of course the 190K (projected) CL and SClass 65 models aren't going to sell more than a couple hundred units a year.  These are prestige or halo cars only.  The 450K SLR will also sell in the 200-300 unit range per year, hardly a spec on the sales chart.  The CL SClass will add somewhere between 5-8K units a year.  MB's biggest sellers are the C andEClass (small and medium sedans just like BMW or Audi) followed by the ML, CLK, S and SClass models in any given year. Mercedes unlike all the rest also has a large group of cars at their top end to which no one else (except BMW in same cases) has an answer for.  The MB sales picture will always be somwhat different.

Now they say that the 5.0L V-10 will be in short supply because the Toureag will take most of the orders and with Porsche contemplating a TDI/hybrid model of the hot Cayenne(no pun intended  :P ), so hence the release of the less torquey(""only 395lb-ft"") V-6 version, already on sale in Euro markets, and elsewhere. I don't see this engine making the NA cut either to satisfy we power hunger Americans. It's likely that the Audi will be paired with the V-10 TDI because the hybrid versions are years off because of development/production delays. It's likely the hybrids won't get here until the new for '09 A8 gets here to compete head-on with the LS600hL if Lexus holds true to what the car will be, V-8/hybrid/AWD technology. BTW, I don't know if you knew or not, but VW/Audi and MB execs met with the EPA and DOT to discuss and finalize the approval on the Bluetec and TDI engines. My guest is they had to assure them that these engines are what they say they are. But surely the agencies will conduct in-house testing to certify they are. Funny how they can inprove emissions tests, which is well needed, but they can't improve or invent new ways of measuring fuel economy. Oh and the old CAFE increases are just a cute way of getting out of it. Why? Why? Why?$200k FOR AN S65 AMG????? WHAT?????  :mad:  Can we all say Flying Spur, which is faster at the same price. To go from 170 to 200k is flat out ridiculous. Very dangerous territory. And I was crying over the 160k that I laid out for my S65. Price increase of 30-fold, huh? So the S63 is looking even better know.    :P            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" ""I'll bet most critics of an LexusLS have never sat behind the wheel of one.  I'll also bet that many LexusLS buyers have owned MB E or SClass cars before. Do I have statistics - no. Just my feeling because it's the situation with the people I know and I'd bet its representative of a large part of the buying group.""You might be right on that because most German car folk have read too much about the car being an isolation chamber and more importantly just looking at the thing is most off-putting so I doubt many would bother.  However on this board, most of the negative noise about Mercedes comes not from former MB owners but survey and graph chasers and folk who couldn't ""fit"" into a Mercedes.  Reading some of their posts its obvious they don't have a clue as to what a Mercedes was or is about today.   The same could also be said about the Lexus owners who talk down about Audi and BMWs, most of them wouldn't and haven't gone near one to even know what they're talking about.  Especially the Audi detractors.  I think the friction comes in when someone on either side tries to say what defines a luxury car, while knocking a car they've never even driven, and know they don't want the other car anyway...for whatever reasons. Yes I have driven the LexusLS, but it was a 2002 model.  I've driven a used 2001 model also, so I haven't driven the 2004 model.  The Carconnection review still hints that it is still too isolated from the road, and others have said that very same thing about the 2004 models so I have my doubts about this ""far tighter"" claim you're making.  The same press that praises the LS' other attributes says the same thing about the 2004 model as they do the 2001 model, it doesn't have the dynamic or feel/roadholding of the German cars.   The 2001-2003 models drove like a Buick to me especially when mildly pushing it.  Way too much body roll.   What you and other Lexi never seem to get is that nobody is saying the  SClass is a ""drivers car"" in the purest sense, only that it is more of a drivers car than a LexusLS.  It feels more connected to the road than the LexusLS.  I've seen a many of post from lsowner talking about how they felt nothing when driving, meaning it was smooth, that isn't what most German car buyers look for, at least the ones that buy for technical not status.   The only true ""drivers car"" in this segment is a 7Series (short wheelbase) with the sport package or maybe the A8L, haven't driven it yet. Yeah audibob was being ridiculous to say the least, and I'm crazy about Audi so imagine me reading stuff about Audi that even I couldn't sell here. michael_mattox, What I said to Lenn above applies to your post about the Allante.  You never even drove the SClass and because you didn't fit into it very well it was a lesser car.  Wow very astute analysis. The Allante was junk plain and simple.  Nobody bought them and even the normally big-mouthed Cadillac would like to forget about the car.   You're a big fan of sales when it comes to Lexus but when it comes to Cadillac you don't mention sales?  The car was a flop and everyone knows it.  The 1990 SClass only sealed the coffin the fwd, underpowered Allante already put itself in from the start.  It was a second car for most so who cared about how well it was made or how reliable it was?  Are you serious?  That is a complete stack of bs.   Fact: in the early 90's Mercedes lead your precious surveys, where was Cadillac.   I see where you're coming from now.  Surveys and sales to tout Lexus, but not for Cadillac.   I've never seen a non-GM owner/fan come up with so many excuses for one of their worst products in history.  What you say about the top alone is just far too surreal to be coming from a Lexus owner.  Would you buy a SC430 if it had a manual cloth top and that only half-arsed worked?  Heck no.  How much more hypocritical can you be about the Allante. designman, I'll have to find the article.  I think they stated the #1 selling configuration for the 911 was the C2 with an auto, not the C4S.  The article went on to say that Porsche was semi-worried about this. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" ""I'm afraid that is true of a lot of cars so why does any one car get singled out.""Are you serious?  You don't know why the lsgets ""singled out""?  Because no other car in this class looks like a previous version of their competitor.  If you don't see this then you're not being honest with yourself.   The A8, XJ, 7, S and Phaeton all wear their own unique styling, only the lslooks like a knock off of something else.  To say that the lslooking like the previous S to imply that a lot of cars look alike is a grand (denial) excuse at best.  That simply isn't true in this class of cars. maxhonda99, Sometimes it is best to not even respond to such ridiculousness, especially when they can't get the sales numbers right to begin with.  This has been the case before, rhetoric based on sales figures that weren't even checked before posting.  I wonder if they even looked at the sales months listed on that link they provided.

" ""I'm comparing top end Acura (Legend before, RL now) to theSClass, LexusLS, 7Series, A8 etc. That's where it falls short.""If power is a priority then sure it falls short. But it's right up there with luxury amenities. Pure luxury starts with plush, cushy, quiet, rife with features. On the high end throw in enough room for people who've had one Sicilian slice too many. It's there and power is adequate. It gets the short end of the stick because we are in the throes of a power war and consciousness. Keep an eye on this new AWD system. AWD is nothing new but regardless it is still in it's infancy. What will distinguish it in the future is performance. The real legacy of electronics in cars is performance-enhancing electronics. In the animal kingdom four-legged creatures outperform their two-legged counterparts by a wide margin. The task for engineers is to figure out how to efficiently apply and optimize power to four wheels in a similar manner, a fairly complex collaboration among engineering disciplines and one which does not lend itself to immediacy. But when people start to notice AWD in warm climates you'll know it has really arrived. The RL could be the first of significant steps forward in this area. This is an innovative move.As much as I consider the RL a high end luxury car, I will admit wondering why Acura doesn't answer the V8 call just on the principle of demand which I believe starts with bandwagon luxury buyers buying into the beating the RL relentlessly takes on this issue in the press. Too much attention is paid to categories. But it could behoove them financially if they just acquiesce, losing the tweener image in the process and beating the ""big boys"" at their own game. They certainly appear have the ability and marketing savvy but with the RL and NSX you have to scratch your head at times.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" ""I've always been curious about something, why cant the Germans manage to put in-dash CD changers in their cars? That is something that Nissan and Honda were doing 10 years ago, and yet just recently Audi managed to actually put one in a few of its cars, and cars that just came out like the Taureg still have it shoved in the trunk. Whats up with that?""I'm going to surprise you and the board here, but Lenn probably remembers my positon on this from a few years back.........its pure arrogance and dissmissive behavior and/or the U.S. arms of the German luxury makers not having their parent's full attention in Germany.  I've said for years they need to start tailoring their cars more to the US market when it comes to details like that. Mercedes-Benz has one available in the 2003+EClass, but not on any other product.   For years Mercedes-Benzes didn't have any in-dash CD players in any of their cars.  The 2003SClass, CL and SClass were the first ones to offer this along with the 2003EClass that has a single+ 6CD changer.   Amazingly, astonshingly, help me out here...the 2004 C-Class, CLK and SLK still don't have an in-dash CD player of any type.  The 2005 C-Class now has a single in-dash CD player.  The 2005 CLK gets one as does the new 2005 SLK so Mercedes has managed to still come up behind the Japanese cars in this regard.  Go figure. Most BMWs have a single slot CD player now with a changer either in the glovebox or somewhere else, I honestly forget.   The most perplexing case is Audi.  For 2004 all of their cars had a standard in-dash 6-disc CD player, but for 2005 they are going back in the glovebox!   They did this is the name of style in the A8 I think and simply because the new A6's interior is so cluttered, a complete reversal of the 1998-2004 A6's interior. The CL600 - ""That much horsepower in a 2.5 ton car is just dangerous and stupid.""So when Lexus does it with the oh-so-often-hyped-upcoming LSClassGT (Car and Driver saySClasshp at least) it will be just as stupid and dangerous right?   Where do we draw the line, 400, 500 or 600??  I guess wherever Lexus tops out at will be repectable and prudent.  Please don't let me down by saying yes to that. ljflx, ""merc1 - you read so much into the power issues. The comments always were that with cars that go 0-60 in 6 seconds on 290-320HP and with great torque - why is there a ""real"" need for anything more. We are talking main stream cars here not exotic specialty cars. We also were saying pour the investment money into things that produce a better and safer car rather than even more excess  power. Need should have a higher priority than excess. In the big cities wherte 90% of these cars are sold you can't use that power very often anyway. What percent of MB's or BMW's sold do you think have 400-600HP. Maybe 5% and that is a real stretch. So to portray that power as brand representation is one heck of a statistical flaw.""Ok I'm trying to follow all of that double talk.  First off, nobody said or portrayed that 400-600hp models represent anything even close to a majority of BMWs or Mercedes sold, where you got that from I don't know.   Basically what you're saying otherwise is that 400+ hp is pretty much useless right?  If so why is a rumored 500hp Lexus L SClass (a sedan not a specialty car) hyped like the second coming of the automobile?  BTW, it doesn't take much money to develop more power in most cases. It is hardly a big resource drain. "" Now it's amazing to me to hear that the majority of Lexus buyers are people who can't wait for a survey to come in the mail and answer them.""Stay with me here, I meant on this board sir.  Please lets not get into comments we wish we could take back from other posters.   Where did anyone try to defeat or dispute Lexus' reliability?  What one is allowed speculate in favor of Lexus and others aren't when it comes to how people fill out surveys?  Come on now. michael_mattox, You mean to tell me they have both a radar-based and a laser-based cruise control system on offer at the same time?  Didn't know that.  Doesn't make much sense either if that is true, I don't know.  I do know that a radar-based system is superior.   You'll love this...on some Sundays I check out the lots here and the Lexus dealer here is moving to a new location (read bigger) and he has not a single LexusLS or any type on his lot,  not a one.

" ""If you, Merc1, can find a BMW cue in the new IS, kindly share it with us. I don't see any. Of course, I could have my blinders on.""I think you just might.  You are kidding about German car fans not giving Lexus their props right considering the last few pages of posts here right?  Anyway it really wasn't a diss against Lexus as you put it.  I just said they look similar, now if you consider that outright copying then thats your view, I didn't use the word copy because I don't think it fits here.  Whether you'll ever accept it or not Lexus does have a habit of making some of their cars look like the car they think is the number one target.   I find the IS to be way more attractive than the GS actually.  The GS looks like some sort of whale to me.  The GS is badly proportioned and way to thick in the rear/side treatment to be good looking, imo. What difference does it make whether or not BMW did put out a concept vehicle or not?  At least BMW, when they do release a concept bring something to market that looks like the concept.  Lexus has yet to do anything even close to their concepts and the new IS surely isn't nearly as ugly as that LF-C or whatever that concept was at Detroit last year.  Not the sports car concept, but the sedan one they did last year too, the GS didn't come close to looking as good as that sedan concept, lf-a/s/e/de whatever it was.  BMW did too put out a concept for the X3, and guess what the production X3 looked just like the concept, unlike Lexus' goofy concepts which don't translate into anything production.   Lexus in particular seems clueless about what concept cars are supposed to do, preview a product.  Even Acuras concepts for the RL and TL are closer than Lexus' to their production RL and TL. Also, Mercedes and BMW usually only put out concepts for a totally new vehicle, not an update of an existing vehicle.  Unlike Lexus, Mercedes in particular doesn't need concepts to debut a new styling direction, and neither does BMW (regardless of whether you like their new look or not).  Mercedes has put out the GST (R-Class) and Vison B (B-Class).  BMW put out concept for the all new 6-Series (Z9) and the X3 before launch also so you're incorrect about them not having put out any concepts.  There is no need for a concept to preview the new SClass or 3Series because they are established cars in their respective markets.  Most carmakers use concepts to introduce the public to a totally new product or to drum up interest for a lackluster one already on the market.  Hence Lexus' concepts for their GS and IS models, bet you won't see a concept for the next LexusLS. BTW, I happen to like what I've seen of the new IS so far, that doesn't mean it is original looking, imo of course.  I'm not the only one that has said this about the IS.

I own that SUV and tho' dated, its still plenty nice. Every day I drive that truck I get lots of compliments. Old, yes... but what a great truck it remains. As to the SC, I am no fan but at only 13 days on dealer lot before it gets sold, its a winner for Lexus. The new GS came earlier than anticipated, with old carryover motors (4.3L V8), and a new but underpowered 245HP V6. Certainly Lexus looks to amend these with the GS350 and the GS450h. As to beating a 5Series, Lexus is NOT a performance-inclined company, thus far. Their forte is luxury, refinement, solid build quality and reliability. Infiniti comes close to matching BMW in the handling and performance areas, and so far are doing a heck of a job. But where is Infiniti in the large luxury sedan class ? Methinks the HELM plays to Lexus' strength, that is why it was easy for the lsto assume the #1 sales crown within such a relatively small timeline.And now, the company is marching in the right path. With cars like the new ES350 and IS350(but still no 6-speed(yet), which are great entries, the company can finally put up a good fight. Late? A decade and half.Lexus or Toyota can certainly put MTs in their cars. After the 2002 release of the IS300 5-MT, with no appreciable uptick in sales or interest, Lexus was wise to stick to its strength in the gen-2 release... The new IS350, even with a slushbox, outruns any in its class. BTW, do I not tote around town in a 6-MT Matrix ? That little buzzy car is fun to drive, and its all Toyota drivetrain and with a Yamaha motor rated at  100hp/L of displacement, and priced under $20K !!! What a deal ! Designman, take note: not all Lexophiles drive around in snoozemobiles... Sorry I digress A decade and a half, is all Lexus' history compared to the 100+ for MB, Audi and others... What do you expect ? Perfection ??? For its short lifespan, Lexus has achieved a level unheard of in automotive history. And the sky is the limit. The LexusES killed off every competition in its path. Ditto the RX, setting the bar for what a luxury car-based SUV should be. The LX continues its remarkable run on a solid LC platform, old as it is.... These are Lexus winners anyway you slice it....Talking of late to the party, how late was BMW and Audi to the SUV party ? How late are they to the hybrid party ? How late are they to the 8-speed tranny party ? How late are they to creating an ergonomic cupholder in their lux cruisers ? How late are they to simple, touchscreen DVD-based Nav ? Oh, don't tell me these things are unimportant, cos they are, otherwise MB, BMW and Audi won't have these in their cars as well.Doc put it best: how high does Toyota/Lexus want to go before pissing off our politicians in DC ?

Ditto MB, where they find most work as ""sherpas"". Here in the NA market where they are considered *luxury* marques, they are way back of sales to Lexus. Granted Lexus sells more SUVs, but doesn't MB and BMW sell more low-end (suspect) lux cars here in the US anyway ? The 3- and C-class being sales leaders for BMW and MB, respectively.What difference does any of this make, whats the point?  For one in Europe if Lexus is going to be successful they will have to offer a low end diesel, and they are.  The new IS will have a 4-cylinder diesel model just like all those MBs and BMWs you like to rag on.  Lexus isn't going to be any different.  One of the biggest reasons why they've been nothing more than an afterthought in Europe is just that - lack of diesels. Further more, do you have the sales numbers or breakout for all these non-luxury BMWs that you claim BMW makes their way on?  If you look at the worldwide sales numbers BMW would probably squash Lexus even if you took out the lower end cars you claim aren't luxury cars.  The only that is really cheap is the 1Series and it isn't trying to be a ""luxury car"" especially in the sense that a dull, boring Lexus is.  Its a drivers car and has won praise all over Europe for being just that.  If the 3Series diesels isn't a luxury car you'd better let Lexus know about this because they're going to put a 4-banger diesel in the IS to compete with BMW, not the other way around. How is MB and BMW selling 3Series and C-Class cars ""suspect"" in America? You seem to be reaching for something that isn't there.  The 3Series and C-Class being sales leaders is common sense, the cheapest products are the best selling ones at nearly every luxury brand in the U.S. The 325i and C230 Sedan should count because they are around 30K?  The C-Coupe models are gone.  The ES330 and RX are Lexus' best sellers and one is highly ""suspect"" in being a re-worked Camry that no one else really competes with, if you want to call a C-Class/3Series ""suspect"".  I don't understand what the debate or point is here.  Are you saying Mercedes and BMW aren't luxury brands?  Mercedes in particular has no trouble selling cars that cost anywhere from 3 or 5 times what any Lexus costs, that is the true measure of a luxury brand.  Lexus wants this same ability and worlwide clout like really bad. Hence their upcoming push in Europe.  I'm glad you finally see that Lexus' sales are based on trucks not their domination of the car market.  The only one of their cars that is truly a hit in their segment is the LexusLS.  Nobody from Japan or Germany is rushing to build a ES330 competitor, the ultimate blue-hair set car.  Lincoln is the only one. ""So when we talk GLOBAL, BMW should not be throwing stones at Lexus. Lexus was Toyota and we all know who is more global between BMW and Toyota, don't we?""Apples to Oranges.  BMW is a luxury brand, Toyota isn't.  Globally Lexus isn't anything to even mention, yet, hence the BMW's CEO's comments.  Though I have yet to read where he threw any stones.  You can't have it both ways.  One minute its all about Lexus then the next its Toyota.  Is Lexus seperate or not?  Toyota sells more stripped down models than BMW does, by millions. BMW doesn't build fwd cars or pickups or inexpensive SUVs so to compare the two corporately is a little bogus.  Toyota, the brand doesn't even build anything close to a BMW at what a BMW does.  BMW had either one of their best, if not the best year ever last year also, sales and profit wise.  Unless you have Lexus' figures seperate of Toyota then this is just more hype. Being ""global"" at the very least should mean dominating your home market, which Lexus wasn't even a brand name until like this year.  Didn't you post upon your return from Japan that your business associates confirmed that BMW and Mercedes enjoy a higher level of status in Japan?  How you can even think or talk global when you're not #1 on your home turf.  Mercedes and BMW rule Germany, with a Audi looking to knock both of them off, no mention of Lexus.  Yes Toyota is global, but so is BMW but BMW and Toyota don't compete model for model, Lexus and BMW do. Shifting the tiptronic here.........I took a look at the GS per your request. First off, the car is a lot smaller looking on the lot than it was on the auto show stand, a lot smaller.  I wasn't ready for that.   The car has too much wheelbase and some very out of place curves/lines to be attractive.  The interior is bordering on bare like the German cars of old, especially in the black interior example I saw.  Then there is the big plank of a center console that looks like it belongs in a LexusLS, not a supposed to be sports sedan like the GS. Remember all imo.  Me no likey at all.  The Infiniti M is more attractive exterior wise, but I think I still might like the GS' interior better, not sure. ""They will compete with BMW not by being the best handling and balanced car, but by being a good handling and performance car in the Lexus way - quiet, smooth, refined, well-built and luxurious in and out.

BMW's have verve and connection at the controls that no Lexus has had so far, and if this is the premise then this GS will be forgotten too.

Very hypocritical imo. Handling- yes it is better in a Benz, but I never said it was the ultimate thing, otherwise I'd want a BMW. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" ""merc1 - couldn't agree with you more on the MB and Rolls analogy. MB is a reliability issue and that's all. They are still in the lead or very near the top in advancing the industry, whereas Rolls went into a rip van winkle sleepfest. In fact the latter - trying to maintain that #1 position in development - is part of the cause of their reliability problems. Another part may simply be systematic to all of europe. I have seen some consulting reports that simply state the current group of European workers (in all industries) are simply not up to snuff with the people they are replacing.""As almost always...well put, and of course I agree.   There is a artist sketch of the 2006 CL at germancarfans.com.  Unlike the nextSClass, the next CL will be a stunner if they come anywhere close to this sketch.

There's not enough cross-shoppers and the two brands - as you stated so well -play to different crowds.""Nope, I can't help livinbmw with the points he has chosen to argue with, and I don't think we need to go back over Mercedes vs Lexus. I think everyone knows where I, you, and everyone else stands on that one.  I tried to tell everyone that the BMW vs Lexus thing isn't really comparable past a few common luxury car points, like 70 posts ago.  I find this debate to be really boring to, BMW and Lexus are opposites in too many areas to give the debate some legs.  BMW fans will never, ever accept a LexusLS type car, and vice versa.   Lexus long ago aligned itself much closer to Mercedes' way of thinking, engineering etc. etc. not BMW's. Now if the Q45 had the following of the LexusLS then you'd have a more even matched debate because Infiniti is really the one after BMW in the sport arena and they did bill the Q45 as a sporty sedan much like the 7Series, but the car has been a huge flop so there aren't any owners around to take up the debate. Like I've stated long ago, BMW really hasn't had to worry about Lexus nearly as much as Mercedes has had to because of their sport bent.  The Lexus vehicles that were aimed in BMW's  direction, the GS and IS just didn't make a dent and BMW has Acura and more importantly Infiniti to worry about.  Will this list include Lexus when the new GS and much more importantly the next IS comes out?  We'll see.  LexusLS vs 745i, forget it.  I personally would take a SClass, A8L, or XJ over both of them.

" ""For MB, US sales position have changed from #1 to almost #4."" They managed to get to number 1 for one year, what in 1999 or 1998???  They did this on the back of the ML SUV which back then was a big deal for Mercedes-Benz because they never sold one here before.   One year at #1 because of SUV and they are supposed to maintain that momemtum and compete with a company that makes fifty percent of their sales on SUVs and the other 50 percent with much cheaper cars, mainly a 35K fwd model. Right. Dont' get me wrong here. I congratulate Lexus for their market success in the SUV area, the Germans are still clearly behind here.  Notice how I don't even dare suggest that this is Lexus' fault.  But how come if MB has increased sales each year since 1993 (from 60K to over 200K) in this country, with higher prices than everyone else, a 4.7 percent drop in 2004 is seen as the beginning of the end?   If anything with such a high priced lineup MB's market share grew in proportion to what could be reasonably expected of a brand with much higher priced cars, in other words they're going to always get a smaller share of the sales pie.  I wonder how many over 50K cars (still the bulk of their models) Mercedes has to sell compared to Lexus tearing up the under 50K segment with the LexusES and RX for sales to be a wash.   What am I thinking money is no object and sales are sales everyone can afford to buy-upwards. I wonder why Ferrari doesn't outsell Porsche or why Maybach doesn't outsell Bentley?  Price certainly couldn't have anything to do with this. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The S350 is a last minue addition and isn't going to just soar past established models in the last 7-13 months of the currentSClass.  Mercedes didn't even tell anyone that the S350 was coming, heck I didn't even know until I checked their website.  They aren't even promoting the car, its a place holder.

My point about this was that no matter what is being talked about styling, engines or whatever it goes back to the same irrelevant and imo lame stuff about profits and what not, things that have nothing to do with anything being talked about.  No one posting here in favor of Mercedes has ever denied that they have some corporate and reliability problems.   ""Regardless, the new spy pictures of the new S looks terrible, and I will agree with Len here that the new style doesn't look as beautiful as the current S, and was something I was refering to in my previous post, that MB will try to over-compensate and screw things up even more. I guess, time will tell.""Yes time will tell because this is nothing more than hype imo, to draw a conclusion about a car you've never even seen before.  Spy photos really mean nothing until the finished product is shown.  All a spy photo can give is a general idea as to the shape and size of the car.  I'm sure you and Lenn will call the next S ugly either way because the current car is so good looking to the point of shaming the lsin that department so naturally you'd want the new one to stumble in that area.  Now that Lexus has come up with a lame styling theme L-finesse (yeah right) you've convinced yourself that the GS is a good looking car when its really nothing but a rework of the previous car with too much wheelbase and BMW hoff kink at the rear and yet poof new styling direction that gets killed by another Japanese car in the M35/45 let alone  EClass  or A6 in styling, of course IMO.

" ""Most buyers just want a mid-sized sedan with luxury interior appointment. ES330 delivers that in spades.""Brightness04?I'm not sure about those spades. A colleague of mine recently got an LexusES. Looks and feels very Toyota to me, not even close to suggesting the genes of the LexusLS. It doesn't seem to have the brand carryover that the Germans have in their lower end cars. Of course, I wished him luck and told him what a great car it was. His response? Ah-h-h it's a friggin' Toyota. Didn't feel like asking him why he spent the extra money. One thing about Lexus though. The service/reliability seems to be raising the bar with the other marques. I don't see how it can't. No doubt, the Japanese figure large in keeping the Germans in line. Who would have known what the Japanese would turn into after WWII. I remember distinctly the days  when ""Made in Japan"" was synonymous with rank cheap. Man has this changed. ""The RL has flopped in the marketplace so I'm done with it. Keep thinking it was compeitive with an SClass or anthing else for that matter. The car has been a complete dud.""Merc? I feel funny about harping on the RL, but I'll do it anyway. I think it flopped because too many people thought the price was too good to be true for the lux segment. I fail to see how the TL was so popular but the RL with so much more big-cruiser comfort wasn't, especially at a price difference which isn't nearly as extreme as jumping classes with the other marques. On HP it competes with the 5 and it has a pretty flat torque curve which means an ample supply on the low end. True, it could never compete with the 5 on handling, or the E or S with image. As far as the 4-speed AT, I'd like to know which buyers in the lux segment know the difference. That transmission just doesn't come into play for lux use, it's strictly a paper comparison. Bottom line: it just fell into a market-perception rut from which it couldn't escape? ""Gee, nobody's buying it, must be something wrong, I'm not taking that chance.""Now I have a confession. When I bought my 530, I lobbied heavily for the TL. My wife liked it also except for the size, so I then pushed the RL and I thought I had a sale. We both like Acuras and the discounts/bargaining opportunities were unbeatable. She drove just about everything out there and the decision looked close. Then she points out, we just have BMW left to test. I was trying to avoid this but couldn't since she is an avid CR reader. Just before she started up the 530 I told her, we might as well write the check now, this is the one you will love, this is the ride with which there is no equal, this is the one that will make you forget about our Volvos forever. Why the confession? It's quite simple. TL or RL would have meant extra cash for the self-indulged designman sports car fund. I had designs on a 911? settled on the Boxster S. Of course I wasn't sneaky about it? would have been too ridden with guilt. But her terse pragmatic response to my reasoning was? take a hike. Thus, RL never had a chance. But to this armchair critic it is probably the best lux bargain around. Too bad not too many know it. Funny thing about real bargains though, the reason they usually ARE bargains is because only a few know it.  :-)            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" ""Sorry but it seemed to me that you had been disputing that. I guess now you're saying that if the difference is 14-20k or more, a higher priced vehicle can't outsell a lower priced one. Well, let's see what happens when we get some numbers on S350 sales vs  SClass sales, shall we? My guess is that the  SClass will outsell the S350. Or are you going to claim that MB stopped selling the S320 in this country because demand was too high?""You can re-word (spin) it as much as you like.  First it was the CLS/E/S vs the C-Class to make a point about sales now its wait until the S350 goes on sale and lets compare it to the SClass.  I mean really.  The simple fact is that you can't prove anything about prestige making up for higher sticker prices.  Who knows for sure as to why Mercedes stopped selling the S320, you and I surely don't so what the point?   The S350 is being added to a model line that is in its 6th year of production so I know that you realize that their are many other factors as to why it may or may not outsell the SClass, not just a price factor. ""it appears you have misunderstood what I am saying. I'm not saying that prestige is 10% or 100% or 200% as important a factor as price. I'm saying that we don't know how important it is. But my overall point is that imho one shouldn't endlessly repeat that MB's sales performance is due to high prices, when there is a factor out there (prestige) which can account for some (unknown) measure of the higher prices.""Then why are we debating this?   Who endlessly repeats that Mercedes sales performance is soley based on price?   I don't.  I've said from the beginning that price is but one factor in sales.  Go back and read my previous posts.  Also, I've never disputed that higher priced cars can outsell cheaper ones.  I've point that out with various MBs vs. various Lexuses for year.  You were the one that kept trying to say simply that prestige makes up for the price difference, which to me doesn't make any sense if the buyer can't afford a more expensive car to begin with.   If its an unknown measure (something I just said in my reply yesterday) then why are we debating it?   ""Fundamentally, we don't know how many buyers are 'priced' out of the market by MB (but can still afford Lexus). And we don't know how many buyers are 'prestiged' out of the market by Lexus' lack of prestige (relative to MB).""Again so what is the point?  We do know that not every single buyer of a say an lscan just jump to a SClass and/or especially an  SClass because of the price difference.  This is simply common sense to me, 14-20K is real.  Prestige is real to people who think that way.  I'm sure most think the S is more prestigious but how many can just pay an extra 14-20K more for one based on their beliefs instead of their wallets?""Every time an MB fan says something like ""it should be no surprise that MB undersells Lexus, what do you expect since its products are more expensive"" I could just as easily say ""lack of prestige vs MB hinders Lexus' sales, its pretty impressive that Lexus still manages to outsell MB"". But in fact both factors are at work, and it isn't and will never be clear which is the more important.""You could say that, but I could say that the bulk of MB's lineup is priced higher than Lexus'.

" ""That kinda does for the Audi line""I find that sticking a ""loser"" badge on the ENTIRE Audi line is just flat-out blasphemy. Take the A4, a great car with some class leading technology and available AWD, long before any carmaker in this field decided to start this. In fact, it has been quoted several times that Audi is the force behind carmakers offering AWD in the mid/high luxury car field. The FSi engines and DSG transmissions are years ahead of other direct injection and sequential shift(ie: BMW SMG, Maserati/Ferrari's F1, with there abrupt shift quality ) transmission.So in order to slap a ""loser"" sticker on a car, one would know what it takes to eventually become a loser. A car's merit shouldn't be based on how many we see on the road on a daily basis, but how well the car delivers on the promise told. And my A8 more than delivers. No other carmaker in the biz(Maybach, Bentley, RR, and Maser with-holding) delivers the craftsmanship and build quality of Audi, yes not even Lexus. It's this impeccable finish that drags me and 5500 other U.S. ""losers"" a year to buy an Audi A8. The car is such a loser, yet in fact, it remains on the best pick lists of many publications and European journals. Yes there are other very interesting entries in this arena. I for one am in love with the SClass, not so much so with the upcoming still-conservative LS460, altho it too will bring new technology and a first-ever LWB variant.But when Mercedes first released pictures of the SClass, people were quick to gawk in horror that they screwed up the world's premiere luxury car. But when it hit the streets and auto shows, the gawks turned into ooooosss and ahhhhhs, even more quickly. Is this car still a loser, or just because it's a Merc and will sell well, we can some how miraculously forgive it and put it in the winners circle??????            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" ""That'd put a HUGE dent in the SClass sales, don't ya think?""A sizeble scratch, yes, but a dent?? I think that intially the lswill steal some sales from the S, but then when MB  introduce to our shores the S450, there will be some variance and some of the losses are due to return.This has been said every since the '92 S. Lexus sales slid with big and bold S. But with the '95 redo, they returned, once again in '98 with the refresh. But when MB dropped the stunning '00 in '99, that stole the show for everyone. '01 brought some good comp for MB, especially since by that time, the W220's quality probs were evident. But the '01 didn't have the fire that the '95 and '98 had, interesting enough. And the '07  SClass has actually sold more of a percentage than the '01 LexusLS, and is still climbing strong, with June being the strongest month behind Feb.But the '07 is sure to have a superior effect on the S. The redesign has been long awaited. And the lsfaithful will not be dissappointed, according to Lexus. The build quality is said to best the outgoing model 10 times over...            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Do you realize how illogical it is to ignore the rest of this brand's lineup to make that most illogical point?    Every single Mercedes, except the C and ML cost more, and in some cases way more than each competing Lexus.  The only places where these two brands line up exactly is at the C vs. ES/IS, ML/RX and CLK/SC, in every other case the Benzes cost more.  You don't see this and what affect that may have on sales?   Recently you're post were...well you know...but I can't believe you think there is an even playing ground in prices here when you look at the both brand's entire linuep.  Mercedes is selling cars (and some of them are ""volume"" models) are prices where there is no Lexus to speak of.  I'll give you that the RX crushes the ML.  I've always hated the thing (ML) and it has never lived up to the MB standard.  Syswei's theory about sales indicating which product meets buyer's demands better is correct here because the price difference is negligible. footie, Did you actually read my post before posting?   Your assumptions about sales are ridiculous....like everyone who bought an lslooked at the SClass first and decided on the LexusLS.   Like I said before plenty of unattractive cars sell.  Yes everyone says the lsis a great car, but you seem to miss it when this same group of people, whether it be press or even some buyers, talk about the car's styling, which was my point...not the greatness of the car. ljflx, I don't doubt any of Lexus' plans but no where in your cheering do you account for the fact that nearly every luxury car maker has a huge product offensive planned for the next 2-3 years.  Mercedes and Lexus (how ironic) are probably the brands with the biggest product offensives planned.  Every luxury brand's dealership body has had to expand, from Mercedes to BMW to Audi to Jaguar.  Audi for example has rebuilt every dealership here (except 1) over the last 2-3 years.  They're all bigger and brighter and pretty good looking too. Motorwerks in Barrington IL has done the same thing - a satellite dealership in Hoffman Estates because of increase in sales and the upcoming product offensive.  Lexus is far from being the only luxury brand with lots of things (product) planned. Have you ever read about what Audi is saying about their future in the U.S.?  They saying they'll being doing 200K cars a year by 2008.  I personally don't see that, but this what they're saying.  They have at least 4-5 new models coming during that time frame.   I think the brands to watch as far as new product is concerned are Lexus, Mercedes, Audi, Infiniti and Cadillac.  BMW will probably taper off after the facelifted 7Series and new 3Series for 2006, even still remember the 3Series is a 100K+ unit car in this country alone. I understand what you're saying about Lexus prices, and it is luxury car pricing for sure, but no matter how you spin the prices for Lexus' vehicles they still don't come anywhere near certain Mercedes models.   The action at Lexus is mainly between 33-55K, Mercedes has more models past that price point that are at least trying to be ""volume"" sellers.  Lexus' most expensive car fully dressed costs the same as the baseSClass.   Anyone who thinks this has no bearing on sales is dreaming. "" Now you have a whole bunch of niche MB's that I haven't counted because I have no idea ofthose sales figs. But they are niche and can't be all that great.""Sort of my point.  They have a lot of these so-called niche models that cost more $$ yet some think they're supposed to outsell a company that has nearly all mainstream 33-55K models.

All the early reviews still say the M5's SMG transmission is no match for a conventional automatic in day to day (automatic mode) driving.  Maybe the next generation SMG trans will finally be as smooth, but I doubt it.  Saleswise AMG and M cars both sell well and will continue to do so.  Mercedes was aware of the hoopla the M5 would get, hence the slightly different tuned CLS55 AMG.  In a Auto, Motor und Sport TV comparo the CLS55 was the equal to the M5 in speed and actually won the comparo becuase the M5 is so uncompromsing on the street, as you noted.   ?

With that said it does kinda have that familar Nissan (Japanese) look about it, kinda like a big Altima or something, and that center console is a little in-your-face-but-plain so its noEClass or A6 as far as styling goes in my book. It does however look better than the new GS.  The Acura RL actually a handsome car from the side and back, but the front is pure Accord.  None of the three Japanese midsizers are a complete piece when it comes to styling, imo...but the M does come closest.   ? I've been told over and over that the M-Class won't offer a third row because the upcoming R-Class and G-Glass replacement will both have a third row.   ? That the Lexus GS450h is a 2007 model year car is all I heard.   ? princeabubu,   ? Thanks.  I'm just not impressed by the ML though I agree it is an all around better truck than before.    ?

" ""The point is aluminum skin vs. steel skin, not the vehicles themselves.""And this mean what exactly?  You stated that the A8 was less ""safe"" than the LexusLS, of which I see no proof.  Sheetmetal has little to do with safety of a vehicle. It is the engineering behind the sheetmetal and the Germans were about safety long before the Japanese or Americans, only the Swedish understood the concept. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"                I've driven the car twice. What I like so much about it is that it combines more sportiness than a 750 with more luxury than an A8, especially on the Executive GT version, which has adjustable heated, cooled, and massage seats in front and back, fold-down picnic trays and privacy curtains in the back VDP style, and an Alcantara headliner. Perhaps its biggest strength is its exclusivity. The 760, SClass and A8 W-12 are all very exclusive cars, but they look just like the much more common V8 powered versions. The Q is unique and uniquely Italian, with no hints of German or Japanese influence. The only problem with that is the electronics in the car can't come close to matching the abilities of a Lexus or Mercedes. If you can get past the mediocre NAV system though, its an otherwise phenominal car.http://photos.ebizautos.com/5579/956726_3.jpghttp://photos.ebizautos.com/5579/956726_7.jpghttp://photos.ebizautos.com/5579/956726_8.jpghttp://photos.ebizautos.com/5812/1009393_37.jpg ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" ""The same can be said of Chevy, Ford and Dodge, with their Corvette, 550hp GT and Viper.""This couldn't be more wrong.  Chevy, Ford and Dodge don't make nearly as many variants of their cars from no hp to 500hp.  Secondly where can I get a Corvette, Viper or GT with no hp in a ""pedestrian"" version.   These cars are specialty models for their repsective makers and don't share squat with Cobalts, Neons and Mustangs that they sell beside.  AnEClass is just that wheter it is a E240 or a E55 AMG. Pure nonesense to even suggest the relationship is the same. ""Your assessment is probably incorrect. Lexus sells around 3300 LexusLS and LX470 alone each month; add almost all of the 2800 or so GX470 which are usually priced over $50k when popular options are added; the a small per centage of fully loaded  RX 's, which has a huge base number to work with, like 9-10k units, even if only 10% of them are fully loaded, that's another 1k units. Add another 700-1k units for SC430. We have what, 7-8k Lexus units sold in the US being over $50k, estimated very conservatively, before even counting any GS model at all. MB only sells 12-13k cars in the US a month. There is simply no way more than half of them are over $50k. MB has a lot of models, but precious little unit sales among its high end models. That also explains why MB quality has gone down the toilet: what little engineering budget there is has to be spread thin.Again, prove me otherwise.  On a yearly basis who sells more cars over 50K was the poster's question.  I said Lexus, now if you think otherwise find Lexus' year end press release and add up all the cars they sell for over 50K.  The  RX  isn't a 50K unless you just want to give Lexus some extra money, meaning it has to struggle to get there in MSRP, if possible and it certainly doesn't sell on average for that price. ""MB only sells 12-13k cars in the US a month.""You are kidding me right?  13K cars a month would be 156K units a year, not the 221K that they sold last year of the 218 in 2003 or the 210K in 2002.  Wrong and grossly incorrect sales theories, look up the numbers.  In Jan 2005 they sold the amount you're talking about due coming down off Dec 2004 in which they sold over 26K units for the month. Present the sales numbers for the SL, CL, S, G, V8EClass/CLK models and compare them to the Lexus LexusLS, GS430, LX470, SC430 and tell me who sells more at 50K or above.  You won't be able to spin the results in Lexus' favor.  The  RX  isn't a 50K vehicle. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" ""Today, the various cars in the class, 745, LexusLS,SClass, A8, STS are all on a converging path.""In many ways they are, but they're not the same either and a BMW still has the edge in roadholding and agility.  My point about the 7Series  Sport back when was that it was on offer when Lexus no sporty derivatives of the LexusLS back then.   Either way you want to word or compare it the BMW has the edge in handling and road feel for those who want it, numbers don't always tell everything about a car's dynamics.   In the end the 754i Sport will outhandle the LexusLS Euro or whatever it is called.  I don't consider the STS to be in this class.  It is playing the sport role more than any one of these cars and it doesn't have the room of an a8 or  SClass either. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" ""Unbalanced Whale?"" This is utter nonsense. They even admitted the car wasn't equipped with the 18"" tires and Euro Sport Suspension and admitted it was not a fair test. You're taking everything out of context.Don't try to twist the facts. C&D never said that the test was unfair. Why would C&D put together an article and then discredit themselves by saying it was an unfair test? Give me a break. The only thing C&D said was that the lswasn&#146;t equipped with sport suspension? and they only mentioned it in order to cover their [non-permissible content removed] and qualify the fact that they mistakenly awarded first place to the car with lateral grip worse than most trucks. Even though the lswas not tested with the Euro Sport suspension, it shouldn&#146;t matter by your logic anyway. After all, it wasn't fair for me to compare the more powerful  SClass to the LexusLS so why should it be fair for anyone else to compare the optioned out LexusLS with Euro-Sport vs. a baseSClass? Talk about a double standard. Even if the LexusLS was equipped with these options, it still wouldn't be a BMW... or even an S for that matter, especially given the Lexus interpretation of ""sport"" that translates to ""slightly more consistency than Jell-O with a hair less body roll than a boat"". On another note, it is both humorous and telling that Lexus advertises its cars with so much European flair in an effort to disguise its roots. The stodgy narrator on their commercials has an uppity European accent and now they try to market ""Euro sport"" suspension... why not ""Japanese Sport"" suspension? Sounds like Lexus is trying to be something it isn't.Most every comparo I read says the car was competent but not very exciting. We've already had someone post the braking distance and the lswon by a foot. (hardly a win). And what exactly are the significance of skipad numbers? I take it we all race our cars somewhere on a track..Get real. Even the 0-60 numbers are pointless. Most of us just drive around town or to work with these cars. What's your point about a SClass/600/55? It's not even a fair comparo to begin with. I would hope a 5.0L V8 or V-12 would run faster. You can only compare the SClass to the lsand not the SClass. You're glossing over the details. Not only is the ls""not very exciting"" in every comparo imaginable, but it's also the worst overall performer? every time. Wake me up when Lexus engineers a car that doesn't perform and handle like a bus. I don't have my Consumer Report library in front of me at the moment, but it would be interesting to see how the lsscored against the SClass in other performance aspects.For 13K less, the LexusLS has more standard features than theSClass. I shopped for both and I know what I'm talking about. They wanted 73K for a SClass 4 Matic with Nav and a few other things. My 62K LexusLS has way more features than theSClass, and there is not a huge difference in performance. The lsis more spirited and comfortable, whilst the S is a bit harsher in ride but better at high speeds.For 13K less, you may get a better ratio of standard features, but once you add options to an SClass you get more features overall.  Besides, Lexus makes you pay for things like navigation and pre-safe, both of which Mercedes includes as standard.  Anyway, something about your statement makes me skeptical. You say that you were looking at an ""S430 for $73k"" with ""4-Matic, Nav and a few other things."" Well that's very interesting considering that Navigation has been standard since the 2000 model year (optional with Lexus) and 4-matic is currently a no cost option (not available with Lexus). The frame construction is probably the biggest factor in the equation here. Electronics as you've mentioned aren't going to make a huge difference. I've mentioned the Airbus vs Boeing Argument. And you've failed to realize no sane CEO of any airline would fly a plane that was not as safe as a competitor. No competent industry insider would dare imply an Airbus is unsafe since it has fewer safety features than a 747.What are you talking about? If, as you say, an Airbus has fewer safety features than a 747, it is by default less safe... Hands down. More safety features = greater safety. CEOs pull this kind of crap all the time right under people's noses. The same is true in the auto-industry. The CEO of Lexus figures he can get away with skimping on safety features and waiting many years before adopting innovations pioneered by others because he knows that most people are ignorant sheep who can't tell the difference. Those loyal to the Lexus cult are eager to drink their special punch because they figure that Lexus can do no wrong, without even checking things out for themselves. For example, I think it was michael_mattox that didn't know that his lsdidn't have rear side airbags... he just assumed it did. Assuming that a company &#147;wouldn&#146;t risk building an unsafe car&#148; is completely absurd. Companies do it all the time? just look several GM and older Fords. It's like putting PreSafe in a Kia..You think all those electronics are going help if the Frame isn't built well? I'm sure MB has a great frame construction, but so does Lexus. I've taken a real world crash in my LexusLS and it barely moved despite being hit at 35MPH from the side. Granted there was 7K worth of damage to it, but it kept everyone in the car safeYes, frame strength is one aspect that contributes to overall safety. But I&#146;m not sure why you assume that Lexus has equally good frame construction. Personal anecdotes are nice but aren&#146;t exactly the best indicator of vehicle safety. I&#146;m sure that more than one person has wrapped their Cavalier around a tree and lived to tell about it, but I think that both of us can agree that the Cavalier is probably one of the least safe cars on the road. Just because you got lucky one time doesn&#146;t mean anything. Now, I&#146;m not saying that the lsis unsafe per say, but I am saying that you can buy safer.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lexus didn't skyrocket at first either, they stayed behind Mercedes and BMW until the RX and the rest of their SUVs got popular.

" ""Yikes! If that is the case the class will be once again sent back to the drawing board. It sounds nice, but a base A8 with 470hp sounds like a little bit much to me.""You thinks thats crazy, try a 550-hp W-12 for '09 and a 630-hp S8 for '10/'11. Audi is getting very serious at taking MB/AMG head on in terms of powerplants. They are even developing new Quattro systems and pneumatic suspensions to handle all the twist that these engines will produce.Audi is on a war-path here in the States. I guess they finally got V-Dub to loosen up a bit and give them more directional stability here. They're developing new and improved ways of producing the legendary aluminum bodies so it'll be less costly on both the company and the customer(insurance). But there is one constraint that I have to pick at: PRICE! I wonder where will this send their pricing strategy. If they're going after MB, then for sure they don't think that they can command MB's primo prices? Not yet at least.BTW, BMW is awfully quiet with the 7Series. I haven't heard anything on the new replacement, but hear that the new car will too send the carmakers back to the planning board. BTW, remember when the A8 came out in '04. It's 335-hp engine was more powerful than the SClass(302hp), the 7Series l(325hp),the ls(at the time-290hp), and XJ(294hp).

My only point was that it seems that anything Lexus isn't leading in is deemed unimportant or irrelevant. A luxury car should have all the latest safety features along with all that other stuff you prize, is my point.  Most cars in this segment probably do have a similar build in their structure, but there is no way for any of us here to know that.

"" If so, then you will agree the marginal effects of such side airbags will also be accurately shown. The VW Beetle is a superbly engineered car, but the side impact airbags didn't make a difference. In the Corolla case, it made only a marginal difference.

It goes to show that a single airbag does not make one car safer than the other.""I don't really think this is a good example because the VW is a two door car and the Toyota is a regular 4 door, seems to me the Beetle is more at risk in a side impact compared a sedan.

" According to my Analysis, BMW makes ""quantum leaps"" in pricing when they introduce next generation of vehicles. And during model years they go for incremental increases. Your analysis?  Oh sure.Historically, a ""next generation"" vehicle is introduced after the current life cycle or model cycle is complete.  Sometimes there is a mid cycle change or facelift or slight modifications, updates, and incremental improvements and refinements.  As a new generation vehicle is released, the opportunity arises for the new price to increase, decrease or stay the same.  This can be a very deliberate and strategic decision in some circumstances.  In any event, there are historical circumstances when the life cycle of a model and all of its incremental price increases resulted in a final price that is just too darned high for the replacement.  In these cases the next generation car therefore becomes the perfect time to introduce the ""new and improved"" model at a ""new lower price"".  By ""resetting"", that is reducing, the price at this opportunity, the price can then incrementally increase once again year after year.  Without this occasional ""reset"", prices would never come back in line as they should, and they could ultimately escalate wildly without limitations.  I am not suggesting that Lexus should reduce their prices, but I am suggesting that you recognize that price reductions and/or constraints generally INCREASE market share.  Theoretically, the GLOBAL (as you put it) automobile market is in a position to afford MORE cars at MODERATE prices than at HIGH prices.  From a business standpoint, it makes sense to INCREASE sales.  So, as the global demographics indicate, the volume of automobile sales will generally and proportionally INCREASE with a DECREASE in price structure. This is just a general and basic rule of global economics.Therefore, to take your argument about quantum price change a little further, it is logical to extrapolate that the best incentive for increased sales is to offer a quantum price REDUCTION!  This will then increase the sales volume even further.That being said, it could be argued that it makes MORE sense to campaign for a quantum price REDUCTION of the LexusLS.  Just think how many more they would sell!!!   :P TagMan            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm not sure about the '02-present A4, but the next car is based on a universal Audi architecture called MLP that is supposed to go into the next A6 and A8 as well.

" And again what does anyone care about this?

This is nothing but the old buyers-care-about-profits type stuff which is irrelevant.Let me try this one more time.  Here is the line from Len that started you off on this tirade:But if you have a lower cost to build you use that to your advantage on pricing and they continue to have a huge edge on the Germans in build cost.Len said absolutely nothing about people buying cars because of fascination with Toyota's profits.  We are talking (really speculating at this point) about how the new LSes will be priced as against the Ses and the 7s (and the A8s for that matter).  The point is that if Company A can build a car for $50,000 that can compete in the marketplace against another car from Company B that costs B $60,000 to make, Company A can potentially charge anywhere up to $10,000 less than Company B and still stay in business.  If A can sell as much as it wants at the same price as B sets for its product, it will.  But if it can't meet its sales goals at that price, A can come down and sell the car for anywhere between $50,000 to $60,000 that it needs to to get the job done.The relevancy right now?  Len has been suggesting that Toyota has been moving up the price of the lstowards the S and the 7 for the last few years, and will be doing it again even more forcefully with the new versions of the lsit will be introducing.  So if his surmise is correct, THE CUSTOMERS WHO ACTUALLY BUY THESE CARS WILL BE EXPERIENCING A SHRINKING OF THE PRICE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THE BRANDS.  Understandably, if someone is only interested in the history, or the technology of these cars, PRICING IS IRRELEVANT.  But for those people who are actually looking at buying one of these cars, PRICING STRATEGIES ARE EXTREMELY RELEVANT.Now, you just have to accept that some people who frequent this forum are actually mostly interested in possibly purchasing one or more of these cars and want to learn about them.  Others may be more interested in the business side of building these cars.  Still others (and I assume you fall in this category) are only interested in appreciating these cars for their individualized approaches to beauty and amazing implementation of technology.  Hopefully you agree that there is room in this forum for all of these folks.Pricing is very relevant to people in the first two categories.  Pricing is totally irrelevant to people who only fall in the third.  [For example, the fact that MB is dropping the price of the  SClass by about $2K likely is not very significant to your interest in the car; for people in the first two categories it may be VERY interesting.]  As long as the context of the discussion is ""High End Luxury Marques"", a mention of pricing strategies available to a manufacturer about to introduce a new HELM car is indeed relevant and appropriate - and to some of us, even (dare I say it?) interesting.I rest Len's case.

" And any car doesn't *drive* according to you ???? Does an MB drive any better than a Lexus, or a Toyota or a Honda ? Like the S-, 7-, the lsis a RWD car, which means a better driving car than any FWD car. That the car *isloates* the driver is a part of luxury Lexus defines.... that which puts the ruts and grunts of the road outside the equation.Lots of questions there.  Let me see, YES IMO a Benz drives better than a Lexus (at least in this segment we're talking about) because the ride is nearly the same in softness yet the S doesn't have the weak steering and keel over like the current LexusLS.  Now please explain to me why you think a car like a lsdrives better than a high-end Toyota like the Avalon because its RWD. I seriously doubt any lsowner on this board has pushed their lshard enough to be able to tell which wheels are doing the driving and/or to be able to explain the benifits of RWD when it comes to handling.  You've got to be kidding me if you have to ask whether or not a 7Series drives better than a regular car OAC.  You should know the answer to that question.  No, feeling every imperfection in the road isn't my definition of driving hence me liking the SClass over the 7Series and A8, but mushy steering and keeling over like the lsisn't my definition either.

" And as we all know(or should know) over 50% of luxury cars are leased, so the case that the lssells better because it's cheaper doesn't hold much water. It most certainly does ""hold water"" if that other 50 percent (per you) still buys instead of leasing.  No on is saying that it being cheaper is the sole  reason for lsselling better, only that it plays a factor in that ""50 percent"" estimate.  A good deal of folks (right here on these boards) still ""buy"" cars vs leasing them. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" And how many S8 or S63 sales would be made again ???? I guess you don't understand that everything isn't about sales.  We were talking about a sporty sedan that is what the 7Series Sport, S8 and upcoming S63 will be, sporty sedans in the full-size luxury car class.  They aren't made just for sales, they're made for people who want some with a little more bite, something I guess isn't understood in LexusLS land.  Who cares what they sell, that doesn't change the fact that they are there. Let's face it, MBs and BMWs derive a huge chunk of their Euro sales from low end 3 and C-class cars that are mostly used as sherpas.... taxi cabs, I mean.. These cars litter the streets of Europe - vinyl seats, no A/C, manual windows, steel wheel covers, pretty much bare-bones... All of which counts towards MB and BMWs *prestige*, eh ? Oh, but here in NA, they market them exclusively as luxury brands... Good marketing that's all... So what, they ain't lost one lugnut of prestige by doing this for over 100 years.  It must be frustrating to keep repeating something as irrelevant as that, because buyers in those countries don't care.   If you're going to ""face it"" then you'd be facing the fact that no matter what BMW and Mercedes sells at the low end their top end M, AMG, V12, 2-door, convertibles etc. etc. get all the glory.  This is something Lexus only wishes it had.   Now if Lexus can overcome their Toyota roots with certain buyers here then surely Mercedes and BMW can overcome some entry-level products that aren't their main focus.  Does it bother LexusLS and SC430 buyers that a ES330 is a Camry in leather?  Heck no.  Ditto goes for a  SClass buyers who sees a B200 Turbo or a 7Series buyer that sees a 130i in the same showroom.     Darn right BMW/Mercedes are masters at marketing, its a cheap shot to knock them for that.  Yes, MB and BMW are pretigious brands, no doubt, but to make them into these super brands is a myth, especially these days. Notice how the new GS is priced close to the comparable MBs and BMWs. How about the new IS and its MB and BMW competition... practically about same. Does that tell you something ??? Yeah it does.  It says that Lexus see itself getting closer to BMW and Mercedes in those market segments, sure does.  The brand itself, years off from doing the same as a whole.   BTW, I don't make BMW and Mercedes out to be superbrands, only that they are more prestigious than Lexus.  The ""Super Brands"" would be Bentley, Rolls, Ferrari, Aston-Martin and the like. The kinda of sentiment MB had back in 1989. Continue the sarcasm... No, that is isn't sarcasm.  Lexus being a no-go in their homd market is called a fact.   It isn't the Germans fault that Lexus didn't start their dominance in their own market and let foreigners have their own homeland luxury car market. Also I noticed on the 2007 lsboard you stated that because the lsthread has more traffic than the 2007 SClass thread that means trouble for theSClass.  I guess that must be the same trouble the better sellingEClass is in next to the much more popular 2006 GS thread.  Too funny. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" And moreover, the lsis a cheaper produced car, and this makes it better than any car in it's class? Yes cheaper at the expense of a flaccid suspension, wood so shiny you could see the food between your teeth, the most supportive seats in the class, the dreaded gated shifter(only a smidge better than the J-Gate), oh, and styling? Dare I say, underwhelming to say the very least. These are things that don't make for a very appealing car to a broad spectrum.More Lexus bashing.... So I take it that the higher priced A8/7/ SClass are better than the lower priced ls? And to a broad spectrum of buyers ? OK... Got it...Hopefully these things that Lexus has corrected, but in Toyota fashion, highly unlikely.. I could bash Audi all I like, but for what purpose ? The car is what it is.. a low seller here in the NA market. Conversely, despite ALL these dishing of the LexusLS, the car remains a TOP seller here. Bash all you like...

" As an alternative to the  SClass and 750Li I can see why, but compared to the 760 and especially SClass this car still won't have the power to compete, especially with the 510hpSClass.Remember how the 4.6L (LS460) engine puts out same HP as the 5.5L in the  SClass ? And the LS460 is already in the low 5s range 0-60. Don't let the 430HP fool you... Its the gobs of torque from the battery and the larger V8 motor that makes this car run like a gazelle... Rumor has it that Lexus has the car pegged to the 4.7 - 4.9s 0-60 (S600 range), and an array of gadgets to really be revolutionary, a la 1989 all over again. What was revealed today were bare-bones.... Since the car is 1 year away, lots remain hidden by Lexus, to be revealed much much later... This car will challenge MB/BMW/Audi, but most especially the SClass despite the HP advantage for the latter... Guess we'll see.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" As far as Lexus cars looking alike, if you look at the cars, in profile, they definitely look much different from each other. The GS has a more rounded profile. The IS is full of particularly sharp styling cues, and is heavily starched, without becoming an Acura TL. The lsfalls in between. So I'm not seeing it either, Merc. A crease here or there, but that's it. Oh I didn't think you would, though in the pics its obvious from the rear.  I agree that the GS doesn't look the same from the side.  Thank goodness the lsand IS don't have the humpback whale look of the GS - its awful looking from the sides. And the ML has obviously learned quite a bit from the original RX300.HA!

" As usual, you castigate every dissenting viewpoint to yours... Hype, wannabe, envy, etc.. Here is a simple factoid for you: can you tell us which MB has had an in-dash CD changer for years and are sold here in the US ??? And as usual your posts are minus the facts.  Yes I can tell you,  EClass . The E has had an in-dash CD changer since 2003.  Audis had them from 2002-2004, until the moved the back to the glovebox for the latest A6 and A8.  A simple check of the fact OAC will do it everytime.   To say that they can't is simply nothing more than hype because they have (E/Audis) and will (upcoming S). Of course. German cars were never defined by cup holders either, but they do now, eh ? Maybe the point escapes you: that the Germans think CD changers deserve to be in the trunk, while a $15K KIA can put one in-dash. I chose Kia, a Korean car as an example here. I could have chosen a Ford ZX3, which is even cheaper at $11K.... And please note that luxury car makers don't brag about having an in-dash CD changer, but it sure sucks if your $60K+ car cannot even provide a basic feature you'd find in far less cars ??? That's the point.... Point is that nearly no one cares as much as people who tend to knock every German car to begin with.  Please note that because German cars don't put CD changers where you think they should be doesn't mean the world or much of anything to everyone else.

Are they not luxurious ? Yes they are. Are they not marque cars ? Yes they are, for each of the car companies.... Absolutely! That is what we are talking about here on this board.

" The company has to do a better here in North America with this car. The A3/A4/A6 and heck even the Q7 will sell themselves, but when dealing with a customer that's about to plop 70-80 large on a car, you must know what the customer is wanting in a car. The current A8 has it, but there has been a huge communications breakdown here that has inhibited Audi's share of the pot. Hopefully this will change soon.And we can always hope that by the '09 model year, Audi will have given up on that ""wide-mouth bass"" front end, or at least figured out how to make it better fit in with the rest of the car's design.

" Based on posts on the SClass board that's not the type of passion to be proud of. Personally I think all this passion nonsense is severely overblown and overhyped. If the passion was real the car would not lose value as rapidly as it does. In the 80's the passion argument made sense. Today it is total nonsense. Really?  The excitement on the 2007 lsboard is surely more indicative of how the car will sell then right?  The new S won't sell anything because the same people aren't posting over and over like on the 2007 lsboard right?Let me see if I have this right, just because Lexus doesn't inspire anything beyond raving about CD changers and driving along in total isolation what others feel for BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Jaguar and others Euros is nonesense.  Yet when Lexus comes out with this V10 sports car and this rumored 400+hp LS600h you'll all of a sudden get passionate about Lexus because they'l truly have something worth getting passionate about right? There is nothing passionate about a car that looks like a Jaguar XK or CLS or the power of an M5 or the sound of a V10 or the design of a car like the A8?

Most Mercedes buyers don't want the full on sportiness of a BMW, but they don't want the Toyota/Buick like drive/feel of the any Lexus outside of the new GS/IS either.  There is always more control in the German car or more importantly the feel of more control than you get in Lexus' core models like the lsand LexusES.

" Both lsand S are sweet, and it doesnt hurt me if lssells for 20K or 80K, its just that despite having a better product, lssells at cut-rate prices, which confounds me.This ""better product"" thing will go nowhere fast.  Mercedes was long in existence before anyone even THOUGHT of Lexus.  Mercedes is legendary with mostly ups and a few downs throughout its life so far, with many bright years ahead.  Lexus came along and was certainly needing to emulate certain criteria to establish itself, and needed to do so at a price point that would foster its success.  Only recently have Lexus folks started to consider that the cars are good enough to be priced at the same price point as the competition.  But . . . do they perform as well as the Mercedes or Bimmers?  No they do not!!!  And only just recently has there been the little IS model showing signs of potential performance.  But the IS is no HELM and there is still no HELM from Lexus that performs as well . . . at least not yet!  There are other considerations . . . styling being one of them.  The newest lsmodels show signs of improved styling, but let's not get carried away.  Other than the LS600hL, they still seem a bit on the neutral and safe side of the design curve . . . attractive enough certainly, but no heart throbbing going on.  Yes, the reliability statistic is still in the Lexus's favor, but that gap is likely to close considerably.  Remember, Mercedes has a long reliable history, and the few bumps in the road in recent years do not change that forever.Lexus, the better product?  There is no justification based upon product reviews of the currentSClass, to determine that the SClass has somehow been trumped.  Again, almost every review puts it at the top.  Currently, the only lsavailable is NOTHING close!  The upcoming lswill be a better warrior and the fight will be more interesting, but the champion to be defeated is theSClass, and nothing has yet changed that.The LS600hL should not be compared to the SClass, and it is a different car of sorts, and it will be a wonderful Lexus, indeed.  There are many months to sort out just where it lies in the mix of cars later this year or early next year.Also, consider that there is NOTHING that Lexus offers to compare to the AMG versions of Mercedes vehicles.  Do you hear that?  NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!Lexus marketers are smart . . . no . . . brilliant.  They KNOW that the price must be one of the advantages, or else . . . or else the ""value"" will fade.  Without that perception of ""value"", things would be very different indeed.  So, put down that famous kool-aid that has been referred to here many times and look at the FACTS.So, who's better?

" Boy, you sure have an issue with the A8 don't you  ? What issue ? I simply provided a link and commented on hard facts. Can't handle facts ?  ? The problem with the lsis that it is an old man's car in looks and in performance  ? And by inference, the A8 and 7Series are for YOUNG people in looks and performance. That's why these cars are in high demand by the baby boomers who don't care to drive an old person's car like the LexusLS! Ooppsss.... The lsoutsells the A8 and the 745/760 COMBINED. It must be that ""car enthusiasts"" are in such short supply otherwise the sales trend should be in the other direction, if your logic holds true.  ? Sarcasm aside, the simple fact is that car manufacturers are in the business to make money. The A8 and 7Series are NOT niche cars, but sell like one. If the trend continues, both BMW and VW/Audi would not be able to sustain the continued loss of market share by their premier sedan, and something will have to give. If the lsis outselling its competition COMBINED, it must be doing something right. Maybe it's time for BMW and Audi to *copy* Lexus' lssuccess formula.

" But from what I hear from Ingolstadt, the '09 replacement for the current A8 will correct all of the wrong-doings here in the States. It's said to come to market with a 4.2 FSI V-8 with about 470-hp/8-speed tranny as the ""base"" engine and a ""clean"" V-10 TDI within the first year it comes to the States. Yikes!  If that is the case the class will be once again sent back to the drawing board.  It sounds nice, but a base A8 with 470hp sounds like a little bit much to me.  I did read that for 07' all V8 A8 and A6 models get the 350hp version of the 4.2L FSI V8 - a typical German car company move as far as engines go. So it all remains to be seen. I'm not giving up on my favorite German brand!! No please don't because I'm not!     Audi is only second to MB in my eye when it comes to luxury cars, BMW used to be #2 but they just aren't pretty enough across the range for me to feel the same way anymore.

" But here is my biggest blunder yet for the SClass: Why is it that the previousSClass/500 could be equipped  no-cost with 4Matic and the new  SClass tacks on a $3k tariff to have the safety of AWD. M-B says the 4Matic will account for 20% of all  SClass sales. They may have a tougher time moving them, then, again, this is MB were talking about........ Well that was only done for the last couple of model years on the W220 as an incentive to keep them selling.  Prior to that it as an extra-cost option. The new LS460 appears not to have AWD so the  SClass 4Matic will likely be in hot demand for those who really new AWD.

" But life is changing fast now. The lsis now the trendsetter with the 600HL and it has set the bar beyond the SClass. Life changes once you are well established. Lexus' infancy and teenage years are history now. Not sure why you'd say this at this point? The car hasn't even been driven by anyone yet. The details of the thing haven't even been finalized and it hasn't even gone on sale yet.  I can't wait to see what Lexus puts the LS600hL against.  I suspect it will be the  SClass because the LS600hL doesn't have a prayer of matching performance with theSClass, but with 430hp and better MPG it will be the perfect competitor to the SClass. As for this whole argument about helms - I find it rather lame. Lexus reaches over $50K with 4 models - the LexusLS, the LX, the SCand the GX. Under the right scenarios you can add in the RX hybrid too. It reaches over $60K with three of those 4 and over $70K with two of those four if they are fully loaded. With the new lshybrid and the GT it will reach over $100K. I don't see how anyone can argue they are a one car Helm or even begin to argue they don't belong. Sure Lexus has some cars in the 50K area, who doesn't?  That doesn't say much, 50K isn't ""high-end"" anymore, even VW has a SUV at that price as does Toyota. Everyone from Acura to Infiniti has a 50K model on sale regardless as to whether or not it actually sells for that price.  Two cars that barely get into (but don't sell for on average) the 70Ks doesn't put Lexus on par with MB and BMW, but it does put Lexus on a higher level than most other supposed to be HELM brands.  Whether or not Lexus is a true HELM depends on where you draw the line.  If the line is 50K then there are more HELMs to be added to the list, but here since most seem to focus on just HELM sedans, Lexus barely makes the cut which is where that one car comment comes in.

"                Welcome back, stranger. I've said from day one that the Sonata is recalling of the '98-'04 A6, particularly the rear quarter area. It's overall shadow is reminding of that car, which was a very elegant and intriguing car to mimic. EClass  quite naturally will pull the grunt for MB, but shockingly to see it's sales this good as the freshened E350/new E550 on the horizon. The R-Class will remain a thorn in the side of DCX NA until they either abandon it State side or lower the price of admission to give it at least a chance, much in the same way Chrysler did the Pacifica. Speaking of, why not invest all of the R-Class' incredible architecture and design into Chrysler. It just seems more plausible to give this type of car to a more American company. Do you think that the 300 will be at home on a Mercedes lot with it's bold design? Probably not.And to hoot, a fully laden R500 will empty the bank to the tune of $70k, which is a lot of dough for a crossover. And with the GL and M hanging over it's head, it doesn't stand a chance here. Interestingly enough, the GL outsold the M for the month and is still pulling strong.As for Toyota/Lexus, Lexus' new/future car product is nothing short of applausible, but we're still in America, the home of the truck. Toyota will at some point have to revamp the luvable but quite old and expensive LX 470/Land Cruiser's as the competition is steadily improving, but those two are still with the status-quo.

" But more broadly on the theme of my original post, I don't know about your circle of friends or family, but only a small minority of people I know aspire/own an MB. Two friends own an MB - E320 and an  SClass - that's it. The majority are BMW, Lexus and Infiniti buyers. I am 42, and my circle don't consider MB as a car to have.What car do they consider the ""one"" to have then?  Is it a singular brand or is spread out between Lexus/BMW/Infiniti?  I ask because I don't know anyone my age that aspires to own a Lexus, even though one of my best friends has one.  He has a 1995 SC300 that looks as if spent most of its life in a museum because he pushes around a beater for the daily grind.   People I know find Lexus to be an old mans car through and through.  Its either MB/BMW/Infiniti and to a lesser degree Acura, with Audi bringing up the rear.   Even my friend that has a Lexus doesn't want another one because nothing in their current line appeals to him, they're all to boring.   He might would go for a SC430, but a LexusLS not on his life. Do we all wish (or aspire) to buy the high-end MB or BMW of choice? Yep.  Here BMW and MB are the #1 aspirational luxury cars by far, with Infiniti coming on strong.  The reality of it is however, 3Series/C-CLK/G35/TL/A4     Lexus' high- end cars like the lsand SCaren't even thought about.  Lexus not being a factor may change with the new IS, because I think the whole thing centers on age more than anything else since my circle appears to be at least 10 years younger than yours.

" Because they are not the same cars...What Lexus is the Rav 4...Or the Chevy that you showed...Even the Camery which shares a platform with LexusES only shares 25% of the LexusES total content...Further all the Models shown were old and out of date most from the 90S.But you see, all of those cars were Toyotas. Toyota and Lexus are the same company, so you shouldn't expect ""Lexus"" to be held to a higher standard of safety than the rest of the Toyota line. Yes most of those are older models, but think of it this way: If it took Toyota/Lexus this long to get their frontal crash tests in order (which they prepare for in advance), how can you expect them to perform in real world crashes where they aren't held accountable through testing?Are you saying that A8 and Mercedes S have better performance..When you have already acknowledge that Lexus lshas better Acceleration...it has better 0-60 times then Audi...Sorry but 0-60 times aren't the only measure of performance. I would rather have a car that handles and stops well (S) than an unbalanced whale that screeches its way around the track (LS). And trust me, if the SClass loses to the LexusLS in 0-60 times, you can be sure that an SClass/S55/S600 will walk all over it in this regard. I don't know much about the Audi A8 so I can't vouch for it, but my instinct tells me that it probably outperforms the lsin most, if not all, quantitative and qualitative areas of performance.

In contrast, the SClass and others were universally lauded: &#147;Mercedes was endowed with road grip exceeded only by that of the BMW;&#148; &#147;Three cars in the group (Mercedes, BMW, Audi) stand above the others, having braking distances of 169 feet or better, and skidpad adhesion above 0.82 g;&#148; &#147;Benz gave a first-rate account of itself as it slipped through the lane-change test at 57.4 mph... 4.3 better than the slow-guy Lexus.&#148; Safety...We have had that discussion and determined neither car has an edge..even though Mercedes invented Air Bags....40 years ago.Actually, the SClass does have an edge for safety. Unlike corner cutting Lexus, Mercedes includes rear side airbags as a standard feature in the S as well as across the model line. Also, the SClass has pre-safe as standard equipment while Lexus makes you pay for their pre-collision system.  And regarding the entire model line, Mercedes has a safety advantage on every car (Standard belt ETDs, standard belt load limiters, standard rear side airbags, standard rollover protection, etc). Lexus likes to skimp and trim on safety as can be seen throughout its model range, but I think this is perhaps most evident with the SC430... A $65k convertible that will literally grind your head off if it flips. The SClass on the other-hand, has had the handy pop-up roll bar since 1989, as does the current CLK. Another interesting tidbit is that the side airbags on the SClass and CLK (front and rear) are large enough to protect the head and the torso, whereas the side airbags on the SC430 (front only) protect just the torso... Looks like Lexus needs to do some more R&D with all that money they're making. I won't even get into the fact that Lexus is consistently 2-4 years behind the curve when it comes to adopting the new safety technology pioneered by other companies.Just add up what we know about MB and Lexus and the answer is clear... or at least it should be if you have an open mind. Apparently you would rather ride in a car built by Lexus, the company slow to adopt safety features, the company with fewer standard/optional safety items, the company with a history of imitation and non-innovation. I would much rather ride in a car built by Mercedes, the company always on the cutting edge of safety, the company with the most available safety features , and the company with an unrivaled reputation for safety innovation.

" C&D included a pre-refresh MB SClass without the new 7 speed transmission and chose the smallest engine available, theSClass, when a more fair comparison would have been the SClass.In what way is it fair to compare a 5.0 liter engined car against a 4.3 liter engined car, when both are available in 4.3 liter versions?  Is this an Aryan concept of fairness or something?  Maybe it was unfair to test a 4.3 against another 4.3 because the MB lost, when everyone knows that MB is really better and really ""should"" win?If down the road a 2006  RX  loses a comparo to a 2006 ML350, can I just say, ""that was unfair, they should have tested the RX400h against the ML350""?As for the 7-speed tranny, even with it the SClass is notably slower than a 6-spd LexusLS, 6.9 seconds vs 5.9 sec, 0-60.

" But you are mistaken to say that Mercedes sales haven't grown as fast as Lexus because of price.  Mercedes sales haven't grown as fast a Lexus, because Lexus outsold Mercedes in market segments where, in general, they are considered competitors. Well Lexus outselling Mercedes is twofold.  First MB, to their own detriment misjudged the SUV market with the body-on-frame M-Class, which also was cost-cut to death to get it down to a Ford Explorer price, which gave it the worst quality scores in MB's history.   This right here is the major reason Lexus outsells MB, because MB (and the Germans in general) were slow to spot the SUV trend and react.  Score a huge one for Lexus. The part about price is where I will simply never agree.  The LexusLS outselling theSClass, is in part due to a price advantage.  I mean take away everything else and you have a car that starts at 57K going against what was until April (S350 is entry level now) of this year a 77K car in theSClass.  All I'm saying is that has to account for something.  How much so I don't know, but to say it doesn't matter is false.  To make a such a broad statement about Lexus outselling MB in general in segments where they are competitors isn't true either.  While the ES330 is an entry-level luxury car, its mission and focus isn't really in tune with any other European or Japanese luxury car company's entry level products.  In short, no one else is chasing the LexusES or even considers it a competitor, at least not enough of one to warrant producing such a uninvolving car.   The IS and GS, where MB and Lexus are more of direct competitors, MB outsells them easily so that statement about where they are both competitors doesn't really hold true when you look at all the models. Something tells me that if MB hadn't dropped the ball in SUV, the sales race would be a lot more interesting because MB has the better sales on the car side already, in most cases where MB/Lexus prices line up more cleanly. Does MB face an uphill battle of catching up because of the recently acquired rep for poor reliablity?  Yes.  Back in 1998 the word hadn't got out yet so they would have really had a chance to maintain their lead over Lexus in sales, if they had a better SUV and didn't wait until the 2006 model year to add a crossover.

" Don't want or not seeing the need for is the marketting equivalent of ""balking at."" With the flood of free money from the FED nowadays, anyone with a paying job can afford to ride in an LexusLS, S or 7 nowadays, whether people actually do it is all that matters as far as the companies are concerned. I'll be awaiting some of this ""free money"".  You're grasping here, really.  My point about the 545i vs its cheaper siblings is that you don't know for sure what the reason for its lower sales are.   I'm sure price is a factor for someone looking at a 525i.  We can only guess, but my point is that C&D isn't a market research firm, they're auto testers and they should know better.    If you aren't going to compare similar cars then whats the point.  The market prefers the ES330 and 3Series in huge numbers too, doesn't make them ""competitors"".  Porsche doesn't offer a V8 sports car and their situation relative to their competition is like totally irrelevant.   Sports cars like the 911 and its competitors line up even worse when looking at price.  Totally irrelevant bringing up Porsche. What's there to weep? Didn't you just say 545i is better handling in 530i in just about any category aside from linear accelearation? So R&T biased towards linear accelearation, big deal . . . NOT.Plenty.  It proves my point about the GS430 not being the 5Series competitior as a sports sedan, like I stated at the beginning.  Read the article.  No I didn't say the 545i was better in handling over the 530i.  You've got it backwards.  I clearly stated that the 530i is likely better handling than 545i because of less weight.  Please go back and read the post.  You tried to imply that it made no difference as to whether the 530i or 545i was compared to the GS430, yet when the right car is compared (545i) to the GS430, the GS430 gets beat, when sport sedans are the topic.   Kinda destroys that extension theory.  The R&T article isn't biased towards acceleration either.   They looked at far more than just acceleration and I think you know Road and Track isn't that type of magazine.  You know they use a scoring system and a car could do 0-60 in 3 secs and still not win overall.   I suspect you know this.

Fewer are shipped here, but still they sit quite a while.  Haven't seen one on the road in months.  Your days supply might be less.  Mine is definitely quite high, especially now that it's 95 degrees!   When I lived in New York, I'd see a few.  But AWD has little value, and hurt acceleration and economy down here.

" E on the other hand is bread and butter of MB (well, in the prestigeous past anyway, before C took over the bulk of sales). Both E and C are being heavily discounted, and both are actually newer than LS320 and ES330; the Lexi have not even bothered with engine/badge updates like MB has since their model introduction years ago. The lsand C-Class both came out for 2001 so they're the same age in fact.   EClass  has the unfortunate position of suddenly being the next to oldest car in a class that has been completely transformed since 2004.  The 5Series, A6, RL, GS, M, and STS are all newer so it would be expected for the E to face an uphill battle.  You act as though this can't happen to anyone else.  Lexus' 1998-2005 GS was just as discounted and towards the end it didn't sell much at all, unlike  EClass  which no matter what its age is always stays either #1 or #2 in the sales race. BTW, the ES330 is only a year older than  EClass  but more importantly the ES330 has a segment nearly to itself, hardly a valid comparison.

" Especially considering the LexusLS doesn't sticker or sell at the SClass and 7Series' base price  ? I'm sure Len can correct you on this, but methinks you miss the point. Except for the SClass, the A8, 745, LexusLS, SClass all lease roughly within same range (give-or-take a couple hundred bucks), with either low interest rates (MB/BMW) or higher residuals (LS). Meaning: even a higher stickered A8 leases for less than the lower priced LexusLS. So who cares about what the cars stickered at ? What are they selling/leasing for ?  ?Now, a car that should be in this discourse is the Phaeton. Nice car. Beautifully appointed. I sat in one at the SD auto show last month. What a car ! Its a shame its badged as a VW, otherwise it should do extremely better than the A8. But sadly, I hear its on its way out.

" Excuse me, Merc1, but Len's the resident business exec here and his inputs are very much appreciated. On this HELM board, every angle to the car business is looked at, not a one-track driving/handling/performance/HP angle you'd prefer. You should be sorry indeed... Whooptie do!  Let&#146;s just say I disagree with the timing of these &#147;business&#148; inputs more than the viewpoints themselves, though in this case I don't think there was a point at all at least not anything really enlightening.   Pluhease,  you act as though that little tidbit was heaven sent. Heck I could have told you that by just looking at the numbers, that most of the growth was due to new models. That is common sense when a company introduces as many new models as MB has in the past year.  The whole thing was irrelevant at best, IMO.  It really seems mightily coincidental that this ""business"" angle comes up in the negative about MB anytime one mentions an MB accomplishment. And while we are on the topic of MB, Merc1, can you explain why MB sells the new SClass as an  SClass here in Japan, while its an  SClass in the US, especially since both are rated at 387HP ? What gives here ???? My guess would be that MBUSA wanted to keep the badging more accurate or they felt that ""550"" would sound better than ""500"" on a new car.  They may have thought that some wouldn't see a new ""500"" as an upgrade so they went with ""550"" instead. I dunno. BTW, in a May 2006 car mag here, the LS600hL is pegged at 430HP, with standard 245/45/19"" rims, compared to the 387HP SClassL, with standard 255/45/18"" rims. The LS600hL however outweighs the S by over 200Ibs... Ouch ! Must be that hybrid motor in the 600hL, eh ? Well I'm sure that is where they'll need to price for it to be competitive because it appears the LS600hL doesn't stand a chance against a 510hp SClass when it comes to performance.M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" First let me be quite clear here. I do NOT care about being credible with YOU. Obviously you have a huge ego about yourself, more power to you. You are a poster here like everyone else. As to reliability, wow... where do one start ? There is too much track record here of your statements.... Lets just let sleeping dogs lie. Thats all fine and good, problem is posting incorrect sales figures, statements about Mercedes safety systems failing and how they invited journalist to come and watch are extremely mis-leading at best, to say the least.  It does a great diservice to readers who tend to believe any and everything they read on the internet and if it weren't for others double checking most of this stuff it would be left to stand as fact, when it couldn't be any further from the truth. It all depends on what you want in a car. Sportier than others suggests others are aiming for sportiness in their products. What if they aren't ? What if each car is biased towards some strength of its maker ? What you have no clue about is market/product differentiation. A product that doesn't differentiate itself is doomed to failure. Do you even remotely get this ?? So pls stop the *ultimate* driving machine sloganeering. It only matters to those who target such feature.It seems to me that BMW has proven over and over that they are just that, the ultimate driving machine.  Now since Lexus opened their big mouth and said they were targeting this and failed we get this spin about this slogan only meaning something to people that BMWs appeal to!  You're kidding!  I thought that was the whole reason for having a slogan or advertising in the first place - to reach a core group of people or a select audience.   All the irrelevancy about customer service and what not the Lexus fans constantly tout likewise only matters to people who place such things above all else.  Lexus' strength and differentiators are luxury, refinement, reliability and customer service. And that's why they have been so hugely successful. BMW may appeal to *sportiness* and that may make them successful. MB may appeal to heritage and marqueness, and that may be enough for them to be successful.  Who is arguing with this?  You act as though no other car other than a Lexus is luxurious or reliable.  The truth is that other cars are just that, at least enough to keep their buyers interested.  The ridiculous theory about Lexus selling so many cars and being so perfect because of that is just plain silly when other brands are in the same sales ballpark, esepcially BMW.  That alone tells you that their are other factors besides reliability and customer service that sells these cars. Yep. MBs are more in touch with the road than Lexus ! You an say that with a straight face ? Have you owned or driven extensively an  SClass and LexusLS to judge that ? Or is it what you read in auto mags ? Nope, don't need to own a car to know how it drives. Another fallacy given here constantly, that you have to own a car to know how it drives.  You're able to tell how a 3Series  drives from a test drive of a few minutes, or at least to be able to tell it drives sportier, but no one else is able to do the same with a test drive of a LexusLS vs the competition.  I've driven the LexusLS a few times now and the SClass many times and my opinions on both as to how they drive are based on such driving experience.  Don't need to own one to see and feel how they drive, don't be ridiculous.  If I made a statement about which car was more reliable or disputed the fact that the lsshows to be more reliable in survey - then I'd need to own one of them of both.  Not to know that the LexusLS keeled over like a barge at Lexus' own test drive event. You are simply looking for something to trump out as non-credible. The post of mine you quote stated NOTHING about a timeline. I said lswas outselling S + 7Series COMBINED. Did I tell you which year that was, or like your colleague, you simply assumed I meant 2005 YTD. So when I specified the timeline, why not prove that wrong instead of denigrating my post ? If you have the facts for 2004 why not present it ? Well it really doesn't require much ""looking"" to see the hype often presented here.  Sales figures YTD that have been light by one month for the non-Lexus brand or articles about safety equipment failing without the whole story being posted - nothing but hype. Lastly, this about Lexus and their product differenation skills is a joke.  They have 4 sedans and 3 SUVs, yet they're so diversified as to make them all boring (except the IS350) and drive more or less alike (again except the IS350), yeah that is product ""differentiation"" alright.  Seems to me they've made their success on making the same type of product for different segments not because they offer something from everyone as you try to imply.  People looking for sporty car that isn't small like the IS or a sporty car without 4-doors are out of luck at a Lexus store.   Seems to me product diversity is something they're only just now trying to do with sportier cars like the IS and to a lesser degree the new GS.  Until now all they had was boring, yawnish sedans and even more drole SUVs. Oh, If BMWs aren't the ultimate driving machines in the luxury segment then what brand is?  It certainly isn't Lexus.  Yet if someone were to suggest that the ultimate in luxury is a Lexus, this would be gladly excepted as some type of fact.  If BMW isn't the maker of the ultimate driving machine from the 325i all the way up to a 760i Sport, then who is?M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" For the first time in a long time, I have to sharply disagree with you: Gotta happen sometime HMM? Wasn't it in 1989 when Toyota had not ONE HELM in NA and deciding to come up with Lexus, with LexusLS and ES250? And this was all supposed to be done in a timeframe of 2 years? Blkhemi: I do respect your posts and knowledge, so permit me to disagree with you, somewhat, as well.When Toyota introduced Lexus in 1989, it was leveraging on a history and reputation of Toyota's solid build quality and reliability. The Corolla was a staunch staple of low-end compact buyers, the LC was legendary for its solid build and off-road prowress, and the Camry was inching up the steep curve of family sedan leadership. OTOH, what does Hyundai have that could shoot them through the warp space of acceptability: The Sonata - a blatant copy of an Accord, tho' solid build, quality of materials still look dated and subpar, but acceptable at its price point. The SUVs are all copy-cats, no originality whatsoever. The Azerra is too new to make a dent in anything for now. That market is owned by the Avalon, Buick, and Ford. So Hyundai needs to be fighting on many fronts:Small-midsized SUV - against Rav4/Highlander/RX/4Runner, etc.Minivan - against T&C, Sienna, Oddy, etcFamily sedan - against Camry, Accord, the perennial leaders, new Fusion, etcFull-size sedan - against Avalon, Lucerne, Ford 500, Chrysler 300, etc..And this does not include starting a luxury arm... Honda and Nissan, despite their reputations, have not found Toyota/Lexus' level of success in the HELM space, what's gonna make Hyundai overcome the huge challenges of the likes of Lexus, BMW, MB, Audi, Jag, etc...? Does Hyundai even have the deep pockets required to battle the big boys ? And what reputation does it have beyond SKorea and the US ? At least Toyota is everywhere in the world, more or less - Africa, Asia, Europe, America, Australia, Middle East. Hyundai challenging in HELM in 5 years ????

" Further more, you and the other LexIthinkIcans can rant about Audi all you want, but the laughs will stop soon enough, especially when the supposed ""dominator"" LS600h 15 minutes of stardom wears off.

Seems like yet another frivilous offer from Lexus again... BlkHemi: I think the HSD can be thought of in tow ways - mpg and performance. Sure you do get some bump-up in MPG but the real story is in the improved performance of the car. The GS450h is a far better performance sedan than its brethren GS300 with same n/a V6 motor. Ditto the 600h will out-perform its brethren 460L when both gets here. But I do not want to point this out too much, if your V-12 A8 W12 puts down 450hp, Lexus's V8-H is doing about same with 4-less cylinders.... The torque number for the 600h should be interesting. I hope it tops 450Ibft... Lastly, key factoids will be the suspension in the 600h, the gearing ratios of the manumatic CVT 8-speed, and how those low-profile 19"" rims will work smoothly, quietly, luxuriously, and yet with better performance all rolled into one.

You seem to imply that I haven't seen the car in person. I saw it over a year ago and again this year and now on the road, and its and ugly whale of a car, imo. ""The new GS is better than any of the Bangled BMWs out there today. No contest there. MBs and Audis are always pretty sharp, style-wise, I give you that. But I have repeatedly told you that MB styling only got better in the 90s. The older MBs are stodgy, slab-sided, but highly functional, rock-solid build and of excellent overall quality. Its only in the '90s MB began the styling direction with their bug-eyed E-series. So, let's give Lexus its due props... The company is only 15 years in the Luxury car/truck business, unlike BMW and MB's long heritage of producing crappy-looking, but highly efficient automobiles until much recently.All highly IYO because while I won't pretend that MBs always looked as good as they do now, but they were far from crappy looking.  Going by how 80s Toyotas used to look and that first ES250 Lexus' cars would have looked even worse than those slab-sided Benzes.  I find nothing wrong with the looks of the 1981-1991 SClass or the SEC coupe from the same years, timeless to me. The 1986-1995EClass also had a timeless Mercedes look, especially the 300CE/E320 Coupe from those years (1988-1995).  Hardly ""crappy"" looking. Toyota on the other hand has long been a the very bottom on the styling scale.  Stylewise Lexus hasn't earned any ""props"" with me since the original SC300/400 and until I see this new IS in person...Yes I'm one of the few that like the new 5Series, but I still can't stand the 7Series.  My problem with the 5Series isn't styling so I don't think the GS looks better in that regard. Styling it seem as everyhing else reverts back to Lexus and Toyotas profits and how they're going to take over the world.  Time for a new line as that one is past tired.

You couldn't say anything other than that previous SClass was the best styled car in the class - anyone sighted could see that.  My point was that anyone who even remotely thought any Lexus, especially the LexusLS was a good looking car or a car with a ""classic look"" can't really talk about the new SClass looking bad or taking a turn for the worse, when Lexus has done far worse - and it was accepted as being a ""classic look"".   How hypocritical is that? My point.  Lexus fans convincing themselves that a car like the LexusLS had a ""classic"" look when the look was anything but, is ""dressing up"" the wording.  The new S is ""ugly"" according to you but the LexusLS has a ""classic look"".  That isn't biased?  Right. I'll give you that the new SClass in base form isn't as good looking as the outgoing model but ugly it ain't and in AMG trim (just like the outgoing model) it is stunning.  Thats my opinion.

Anyway, the cars you mention don't have the exact same taillights in the way they could be changed out from car to car like you suggest.  Totally off there doc.

Not by a long shot.  The CLS flat out stomps holes in anything from Lexus. Have you taken a good look the new ES?  Nothing more than a collection of LS/IS cues with even more slab siddedness.   But I guess you'd only mistake one Audi model for another, but not Lexus because they're still different enough from model to model right?  Right. A 1995 7Series better looking than the 2000SClass?  Ok. In AMG trim the outgoing S had no equals in styling until the current A8 came along. The 5Series I like also, but I wouldn't call it the sexiest sedan on the road.  It is edgy, aggressive and mean looking in the BMW tradition with a much better rear than the 7Series. You've got that about the 92 SClass way, way backwards, it was poorly done 2001 replica LexusLS that was past its prime mimicing a car ""designed in the 1980's"" as you put it.

" GS and IS, even in their best years, could not begin to compare to LexusES and RX sales. The same can not be said ofEClass. That's why GS and IS in their waning years was nearly as significant the decline ofEClass. It will next time they do since they GS and now IS are big contributers to Lexus' sales now.  You won't be able to fall back on this excuse if and when they start to decline in a few years.   EClass ' decline was to be expected in the face of 5 freshly minted competitors!  Same thing happened with the previous GS, only thing different is the timing and the numbers of new competitors in the last 12-18 months. We all know what one of the main reasons they LexusLS outsells the rest of the class is, but of course you'll just say price doesn't matter since everyone can lease so I'm done with that. Also, isn't proper managing of production and maintain brand/model prestige what a luxury marque maker supposed to do? Flooding the market with cars that need heavy discount does not jive well with maintaining marque value.Yes it is. Finally something I can agree with.  Why they added the S350 this year is beyond me since there won't be a 2007 S350 version of the newSClass.  I guess they didn't want to drop the sales title to the 7Series in the final year of the W220 production. IS300 actually did quite well in the first couple model years. There was no heavy discounting in the first couple model years like what's available on R-class today, within a few short months after introduction. Yeah sure, quite well compared to what?  Not the 3Series or any other cars it targeted.  Lexus simply deciding to let the car die instead of discounting is their choice. I think the truth of the matter is that even with discounts no one wanted the previous generation IS300.  It wasn't like they held it at MSRP and settled for small sales.  They discounted the thing and it still didn't move!  Like I said, the verdict is still out on the R-Class, being a few months old. BTW, the first generation GS300 was quite a different animal from the GS that we know since 1998. Excuses, excuses.  The 1993 GS300 is much like the 2006 GS300, slow.  The only difference/addition to the GS lineup since the beginning is the addition of a V8, the GS400 and then GS430, which very few people bought during the 1998-2005 model's production run.

" I didn&#146;t say the top view was the driver view. Essentially, I said that it contains the IMPRESSION I will see when I finally get to sit in the driver&#146;s seat. It is the shot that gives me the sense of actual proportions, dimensions and ambience. Actually, I think Len was right the first time on this issue.  First, I have to say that we haven't actually sat in the new car yet, so we are really all just speculating.  And certainly, as designman said, pictures can lie.  But the low perspective of the first pic is not one that the driver would ever see to create any impression.  I am pretty confidant of that based on experience with the current model, which has a very similar long lower expanse on the passenger side.  What isn't so obvious is that most of the lower mass drops away towards the front of the car, so it doesn't show up to either the passenger or the driver nearly as much as this picture seems to suggest.  For example, the items on the lower part of the driver's side can't be seen at all by the driver; as a matter of fact, one of my complaints is you have to feel your way to hitting the gas tank flap opening button - there is no way you can see it without twisting your body way down low.And I actually like the shape of the center stack more than in the current model.  To my eye, the NAV and electronics at the top of the stack coordinate much better with the lower portion; the one thing I don't like about the current version is that there is no smooth transition from the dash materials at the top to the wood panels below.  The vertical ribbon of buttons along the sides in the new version better pull the whole stack together.I also like the more monotone color of the display model better than the high-contrast two-tone version in the pics you posted (even though both my lsand my MB E have the similar two tone beige/taupe theme).Yikes, now I'm disagreeing with designman and, perhaps, Len, too.

So you are saying a single  SClass model is enough to hold off the LS460, LS460L, LS600hL, 7Series, 7SeriesL, A8, A8L, XJ ?? Methinks not. MB needs another one to supplement the  SClass pretty quick. By next spring, the LS600hL arrives here, and MB suddenly has 3 lsseries sedans to battle against using one SClass, or maybe a possibleSClass. But MB is known to have far more variants than Lexus, so it'd be strange if the role is reversed, don't you think ? And I don't count the very low volume S63/S65 here.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" I firmly believe that lsshould move from ""Value HELM"" to ""premium HELM"" in line with 7Series and A8. This is because this is the natural outcome of evolution in LS's life. I agree Lexus can move up the price ladder...they have been doing so for the last 17 years...but I don't expect them to necessarily move to parity with the 7 in 4-5 months.  Though it could happen that soon, it could alternatively take years more.  And I'm not about to second-guess Lexus management if they decide not to do it in 4-5 months.  There can be sound business reasons for pricing lower than the competition, even for luxury goods.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" I see your point that lexus had to offer cut-rate prices to win market share and awareness, but now that it has all of that, I see now reason why lsshould offer cut-rate pricing anymore. Well, you are making progress here.     Yes, you see that Lexus had to offer cut-rate prices to gain market share and awareness, but what you are describing is the""value"" associated with that awareness.  Steve, it is an integral part of the Lexus success formula.  There have been countless hours of discussions about this on this forum.  Many before I came on board and many since.  The U.S. Lexus strategy is about that ""value"" perception.  Without it, some may still choose the Lexus, but the equation takes a deep dive into a different direction, and it is absurd for Lexus to change a winning formula.  Only a car like the LS600hL can take a slight detour from the strategy because it is unique enough and offers something BEYOND the competition in a certain sense.  But even with that car, to venture too far off the successful path would be business suicide.  From a business standpoint, there is no good reason to fix it when it isn't broken.  In fact, it is FAR from broken . . . it is a well-oiled machine, a Swiss watch, a comet in orbit . . . something that just works almost too good to be true.  To change the formula would be downright stupid, IMO.Take it a step further.  Just considering the way that many Lexus fans think that Lexus vehicles could be priced higher is, in itself, a perfect example of the achievement of the ""value"" perception.  It is, by definition, the whole point. If Lexus fans did not think that Lexus vehicles could be priced more, than the entire ""value"" perception would not exist, would it?  Do you get it?  It is an integral part of the strategy and formula.  In other words, Lexus fans think that way because they are doing exactly what Lexus has in mind for them.It brings up the question: is this ""value"" perception a ""perception"" or ""misperception""?  That is more subjective, but I will tell you that it is a genuine perception, and it must be for the formula to work.  Lexus vehicles are in fact a great value.But, a great ""value"" doesn't make them equivalent in all regards.  It makes them what they are, and no more or no less.  The new lsmodels will continue in the same brilliant fashion . . . they will be terrific ""values"", maybe even MORE so than previous generations.Again, ""value"" is an essential and integral part of Lexus strategy.  Get used to it.  Appreciate it.  Embrace it.Oh . . . one more thing . . . ""value"" doesn't necessarily mean ""better""!!  TagMan            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" I still don't see the point of a GS450h when the GS460 is going to cost likely less with more power. To have a GS450h to save a few gallons of gass with a much smaller trunk than the already too small trunk of the GS430? Doesn't really make sense to me. Then there is the fact that Lexus will only sell 2K units a year, hardly enough for any other luxury maker to take the GS450h seriously.There may NOT be a GS460 afterall... Lexus may simply one-up the market by putting the 5L V8 in the new GS and IS, and make these the sporty versions, while the GS450H becomes the cousin to the 2007 GS350 arriving this Fall.Now the LS600h may be a different story, but the SClass obviously has nothing worry about nor does the 760Li, but the LS600h does make an interesting alternative to the SClass/750Li. Still speculation for now, but something tells me MB is not thinking like you. They will see the LS600hL as a direct competitor to theSClass.

" I did go way way overboard. I just can't stand that denaliipna and merc1 kept saying MB's style (which is so subjective) is better than Lexus.So you can't stand that denaliipna and merc1 are correct? Yes this is a subjective area, but in my opinion MB styling is much better than Lexus. Lexus has no design identity of its own. All Lexus does is mix and match design elements from other brands to form a bland mutt of a car. For years Lexus has been ripping off Mercedes, but I think the most blatant imitation has to be the current LexusLS, which was heavily influenced by the S. The few times that Lexus has ventued off on its own without holding Mercedes' hand has been disasterous. The LexusES looks like utter trash and the SC430 is quite possibly the ugliest car on the road. Let those people buy those European junk cars. They will learn except for those fanatics. I and all the friends and relatives did learn from mistakes. Does MB know that if Lexus didn't exist, they would sell a lot more cars? Again look at electronics. I used to own German TVs, but now I only buy Japanese. No, you don't sound like a Lexus fanatic at all. Not one bit. In fact, it sounds like you have done plenty of research and applied much logic to support your ""European junk"" claim. :sarcasm: As far as your TV analogy is concerned...Apples and Oranges. Did you know that MB outsells Lexus around the globe and in America MB sells more cars than Lexus? The RX SUV (aka raised Camry) is the only reason why Lexus total sales in the U.S. are higher than MB. All that will change shortly with the new M-class Even if MB were the same price as Lexus, I think Lexus still beats MB in safety, value and reliability (all objective criteria).Reliability and value maybe. But definitely not safety. Please, I am interested in your logic as to why Lexus is safer than MB. Is it because Lexus never innovates in safety? Is it because Lexus is slow to adopt safety features? Is it because Lexus doesn't offer as many safety features as MB? That is a very interesting perspective indeed... :/ Especially considering that MB spanks Lexus in all three areas: Innovation/Introduction/Features            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" I still feel you are looking at this the 'old fashioned' way, in that companies operate by designing and building what they think a product should be for a particular segment. That's bassackwards in plainspeak.  Companies that operate the way you suggest these days struggle to hold customers. The Euros all do this. They've got that old fashioned German scientist engineer thing down pat where they think they know what's best for the customer. Unfortunately, this kind of rocket science has got them in a lot of trouble.  Companies that design cars that their customers buy in droves are in fact designing and building exactly what the market wants, not what they think the market needs. The measure of success is the money they make, the share they gain, the positive press they receive.  Companies that are in trouble financially are failing to make what the market wants. I think you're taking my post out of context.  What I mean is that every luxury car maker has their theory or idea as to what a luxury car should be, not that they should dictate what the market gets.   All car companies listen to their customers in varying degress, but there are differences.   What Lexus thinks a car should driver, look and feel like is their philosphy at work, ditto for Audi, BMW, Mercedes and every other brand here.  If every brand had the same ideas we have a bunch of Lexus like cars or all BMW type cars.  I didn't say that MB or anyone else dictates what type of car the customer should have, rather its that each brand has a take on the luxury car theme. Also, if Lexus' way was so superior they'd be the bestselling car in every class don't you think?  Yet they're far from it.  The LexusES plays a game no one else is playing, the GS and IS have always had a hard time staying popular so obviously Lexus either doesn't listen to their customers, or they aren't giving what the market wants, going by your theory.   The lshas a good take on the idea of what most would consider an ideal luxury car, plus being priced below its main compeitition equals a hit.   Why do you think MB dumped its boss this week? Because the board thinks the cars don't handle right or ride right? No, I think he failed to realize the hole he had dug and couldn't get them out of it. New management was needed before this turns into their own Little Big HornI agree with you here, had nothing to do with car design.

" I test drove the GS430 yesterday. It is absolutely spectacular and I'm trying to figure out a reason to lease one. Lexus hit it perfect as far as I'm concerned. Driving the car made me realize how easily Lexus could have pushed it further (quite easily) on the sport handling side. But then they would have lost some of that great luxury ride feel. As it is they gave a great and perfect balance to both sides of the fence for a car in this class. Sorry but after reading that I would say the same bias applies to you, or either you don't understand what a proper sports sedan  is supposed to be.  The GS was supposed to be a 5Series fighter and it is not, but of course you find it to be perfect.  I'm biased for not liking a GS, yet I'm able to admit and post what I honestly think of every Mercedes, whether it is favorable or not.   You on the other hand think that every Lexus product is perfect and that the isolated/sound system/nav combo can't be had anywhere else.  This to me is a ""shame"" imo.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, I find the Lexus GX470 and SC430 to be interesting vehicles and if I were a buyer in those markets I'd drove those Lexi, but the GS imo is about the ugliest car in the segment and on other things that appeal to me (not you) the GS is behind the M45, A6, E, and 5Series.  Saying you drove it and you realized how much more ""easily Lexus could have pushed it further (quite easily) on the sport handling side"" to me shows more bias than anything I've said.  You've basically invented an excuse for the car not being sporty enough to challenge the rival Lexus fingered.   If I had said something like that about a Mercedes the board would be up in arms about me making excuses for the MB not achieving its goal.   How much they could have made it sportier?  That sir is an incredible bias. Can't even admit that they failed as a ""sports sedan"" only to get beat by a fellow Asian brand in that regard. BTW, I'll be in line to drive the new IS250 like everyone else.  Very excited and interested in such a car, but obviously it doesn't apply to this set. I know you don't care about sport, but that is what Lexus stated for this model.  Read the other boards where people don't apply LexusLS type thinking to the GS and you'll see they prefer the M45 and the Lexus doesn't cut it.  Sure it has all the regular Lexus attributes and that is fine for many (obviously), but as a true sports sedan it doesn't cut it. Don't cry ""your not objective"" because I don't think every Lexus is perfect like you do.

" I used to work in the liquor industry a long time ago.drinking or marketing?    So it is with diesel - it'll just never get started here and it's so hard to invest in a technology that has been rejected. Hybrids though are a natural and seamless extension of gas.I agree with this, but to a lesser point.  You use the word never regarding the diesels, and when I consider that such a large number of vehicles in Europe are diesels, I find myself going back to basics here.  With more expensive fuel costs, diesels represented the long-standing ONLY alternative.  Obviously there were no hybrids all those years. So, let's cross the Atlantic and come back to the good 'ol USA, and recognize that for the most part during our history, fuel has been cheap enough to go through the years of muscle cars and giant SUV's.  But now, there is change in the wind, and with the new generation of diesels that will be offered over the next years, I think we will see diesels slowly take a foothold for the first time in our history that could be considered significant.Yes, I agree with you about the logical extension of hybrid technology and it will be marketed successfully.  But I also now am witnessing an interesting polarization of the hybrid.  In other words, I think the hybrid will do very well at the economical end of the spectrum, where it actually financially pays for itself in real monetary terms, such as the Prius and Honda Civic Hybrid, and the upcoming Honda Fit . . . AND hybrid technology will probably do well in the upper end, such as with the upcoming Lexus LS600h.  This polarization that I am predicting will leave the middle ground open for more efficient ICE engines and DIESELS, IMO.  Additionally, diesels can gain ground in the economical end of the spectrum, alongside the hybrids, AND the upper end of the spectrum, in the HELMS.  I have a firm belief, especially when I consider some of the passionate posts on this and the LPS forums, that MANY folks would just LOVE to have a terrific car with a terrific diesel as its powerplant.One hour ago, I heard on the news that gasoline will rise at least 25 cents per gallon this summer.  This will flirt with the $3 + per gallon area again . . . and that seems to be the trigger point for folks to start complaining and looking for alternatives.

" I sure hope GS and IS sales numbers will become a significant contributor to Lexus sales overall. Even at half the volume of LexusES or RX (each close to 100k vehicles, give or take 20k), that will be like another 100k vehicles per year. 300k vehicles a year would be enough to overtake BMW global sales with sales in the US alone! Unfortunately, the GS production line is not much greater than current lsvolume (about 20-30k a year), and IS is only set around 50k units per year. Lots of doubletalk here, really don't understand any of it ..especially about Lexus overtaking BMW in sales worldwide with on volume in the U.S. alone?  What the hell?  Makes no sense at all. The 1gen IS300 was never targetted to overtake 3Series in sales volume; the production line was only 20k units per year, 1/3 of 3Series sales volume in the US alone. IS300 sold every car there was in the first couple years without heavy discounting. In fact, you could not get close to invoice like normal discounting until the 3-4th year. The car never had $10k+ discounts even to the end like MB is doing on many of its models Saying they sold every unit doesn't mean anything when they didn't bring over that many in the first place!  It like saying productin is sold out when production is low to begin with.  No matter how you spin it the car flopped big time.  Period.  The car never had 10K discounts because a car in the 30-35K segement doesn't typcially have an extra 10K than can be take off to sell it.  Very disingenuous remark.   As to the argument that lssells more due to lower pricing, well, lump-sum $50-70k is actually much more expensive than $450/mo in cash-flow equivalence analysis, assuming disinterested bank rates and normal depreciation. It actualy would not surprise me if MB decide to bring the S350 over in the next generation; if it can make money at $450/mo with it, there will be buyer/leasers. 265hp is plenty enough for a car like that, for chauffer purpose and short business runs in town.

If it helps, I do think that Lexus is more sophisticated a car than Buick but, FWIW I never mentioned Buick, That was the good Mr.Tagman. Again FWIW for me reliablility would comes as a lower priority than performance. Something that Lexus does well. I can live with some glitches to have a car drive a certain way that I feel appropriate. This is what many have been saying all along.  All you have to do is read the postings on various Germancar boards vs. Lexus and you'll see a clear difference, especially when talking about the LS/SC/ES. Now the GS and IS are somewhat different, especially the IS.  Perfomance never, ever comes up and when it does and the Germancar outperforms the Lexus, you'll get the it doesn't matter response because this is America and you can only drive 55/65/75 mph anyway.

" I'm sorry, I'm still having trouble figuring out why I would need the LWB version of the LexusLS. To me, it is only relevant to the chauffeur-driven executive.

Some upscale real estate agents have the 750Li and specifically want the L so their clients have extra room in the backseat.

" If not, why does the 6 cyl E350 sell so well vs. the 8 cyl E500? When I bought my E320 in 1998, I was fully satisfied with its 6.9 sec 0-60 vs. 6.4 for the E430. I would imagine a lot of people are making the same valuation now, with an $8350 MSRP price differential between the starting prices of the current models (yes, some of which is due to other options included on the E500). Well thats a different class and the E350 is more competitive with other cars in that class compared to what a 335hp S450 would be compared to the 7SeriesL, 07' LS460 and A8L.  Plus the E's market segment is dominated by six cylinder engines which typcially aren't known for big hp numbers anyway.  I just think they'd be better off at least making the S450 look more competitive on paper with more hp for it. MB will bring in the S450 as soon as it has excess production capacity over the demand for the more-profitable SClass. When that will be is beyond my ken. They're just not going to say when too early for fear of slowing down  SClass sales. I'll buy that.  I think they may be trying to see where the LS460 will price in addition to what you've stated.

" I wonder if the Crown Majesta should have been the GS. It would have done more damage to anEClass than current GS will do to a 5Series IMO.I have to agree with you here, Len.  The relationship between the LexusES and the GS300 has always been confusing to me, even understanding the large technical differences between them.For example, in about a year I will be looking for a replacement for my '98 E320 (extremely low mileage) that my wife is now driving, and I can't figure out what to get for her.  She's no sports car driver, but unless an AWD version of the LexusES becomes available, I'm not sure I'd want to see her in a FWD car.  And the GS300AWD is too small in the back seat to be practical, but the lsis more car than she wants.  She's not going to like the interior of the 5Series, and neither of us can stand to look at the nose of the A6.  And I'm not ready to assume that MB has fixed the reliability problems of the E yet, although perhaps by then I will be - but I think a new version will be coming out around then, and that really makes me nervous!  All of which leads me to believe that if the Majestic has a better back seat than the GS (the pics make it look like it does), it might be the answer for her.Of course, the best answer may be to convince her to take my LexusLS, and then I can justify getting the new one!  :shades: Bottom line questions for lexusguy:  wouldn't it be nice to have a ""baby LS"" in the showroom, rather than just a gussied-up Camry and 2 versions of an poorly-sized sport sedan?  Would the Majesta fill that role?            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" IMO, either the  SClass or LS460L depending on how the price factor plays out.Yeah, it will really depend on how much weight C&D decides to put on the Lexus' price advantage.

" In the >90K price range, the number of MB car sales are so small as to be insignificant. The price range that counts is the $50 - $80K. That is the sweet spot in the market we are talking about here, and that is where Lexus outshines the others, as the market has spoken.  That maybe the case with the ""others"" but it certainly isn't the case when it comes to Mercedes-Benz. At the  50-80K ""sweet spot"" price point, that statement is incorrect if you're referring to Mercedes.  Since 2005 isn't over yet, let&#146;s look at 2004. Mercedes has roughly 4 models that sell in your noted price range of 50-80K, the G, E, CLK and most of theSClass. Now between the E, S, CLK, and G-Class Mercedes sold 103,461 cars that cost roughly between 50-80K in 2004.  Those numbers don't even reflect the CL, SClass and SLR at 2683, 12,885 and 45 units respectively, all of which sell at prices way above any Lexus.  In the >90K price range, the number of MB car sales are so small as to be insignificant.  Sorry, but just because Lexus doesn't sell anything past 70K doesn't mean the 12K+ SL's Mercedes sold last year at 90K+  are ""insignificant"". Such a statement can't be taken seriously as no one else even comes close to such volume at that price point. Why is it that if Lexus doesn't do it, it is deemed insignificant?  Anyway, back to your original statement about the 50-80K price bracket.  Lexus has the LexusLS, GS430, LX470 and SC430 that sell between the 50-80K price points you mentioned. I couldn't find the total number for 2004 for the SC430, but the GS, LexusLS, and LX sold 50,380 units. This is counting the GS as a whole because if you look at the just the GS430, which is the only 50K GS model the 8,262 units the ""GS"" sold last year would be a whole lot less. A whole lot less considering hardly nobody bought a GS430 last year.  (Even with the new car the GS300 is by far the majority of GS sales, but thats another story.)    Even if you add the 35,420 units the GX470 sold last year and add say 12K SC430 sales last year (which I don't think it sold that many), you still get 97,880 units which is still below the Mercedes total. The SC430 number is very generous imo as I seriously doubt it sold that many in 2004.   If you take away the GS300, you'd most likely wind up with about 90K units for Lexus sold in that 50-80K price (which is very impressive I'll admit) range compared to roughly over 100K units for Mercedes. Now if you have differing numbers I'd like to be corrected here, especially about the SC430 which I admit I'm guessing since I couldn't find a grand total for 2004 anywhere.   Except for a huge number of SC430 sales way over what I gave, switching the price bracket doesn't change anything.  Plus you're ignoring the extra 15,613 units Mercedes sold over your 80K price bracket. Either way you want to chop it, Mercedes is still the #1 choice for the mainstream, high-end luxury car buyer.   The world of Bentley, Aston-Martin, Rolls-Royce and Maybach is quite different. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" In the case of MB you are rewarding them for tremendous inefficiencies in their production process and bad cost controls overall. They have to get those prices because they'd be bleeding to death without them. In CFO land this is the ultimate no-no. On the other hand you are penalizing a brand that is lean and mean and can price aggressively. In CFO land this is another major no-no. All things being relative MB has had to substantially reduce its mark-up over its costs to produce its cars in the last 15 years. All very nice and what not, but largely irrelevant to this discussion.  No one cares as to why a car is priced the way it is, nor do I dispute what you're saying about MB's fixed costs.  Everyone knows that Germany is the most expensive place in the world to build a car and add that that a non-Toyota-like way of building them and poof(!) here come your huge sticker prices.  You're right, but that isn't the focus of this discussion at the moment.  We were debating who is a HELM and who isn't.  But all things are not equal and you cannot penalize anyone that has big cost efficiencies and a big build cost advantage because they are using that as an advantage in price. IMO a HELM is a market perception issue and a lux feature issue. Sure I can because cost isn't the only issue here.  Lexus is synthetic, it is a name plucked out of thin air during a 1987 Toyota board meeting.  It lacks the sense of occasion, the heritage, there is no sizzle to the nameplate, nothing to read about pre-1989. I can see the issue dr. fill raises clearly because in the US Audi lacks the first one but has all, and then some of the second one. I certainly consider Audi a HELM - I just don't think they will ever make it big here. It's not going to be overcome by marketing either. It's an image problem and it will take a phenomenal US investment to overcome.I see the issue and the point that he is making, but my point wasn't that Audi is above Lexus, it was that neither Audi or Lexus is on the same, equal level as Mercedes and BMW.  I agree it would take a miracle in today's market to get Audi to the volumes and presence that other HELM's enjoy, but anything is possible.  In 1992 they were at 12K units a year and really on the brink of leaving the U.S. market, despite what Audi management said at the time, they were.  This whole status thing with Lexus changes by the hour.  One minute we're told the Lexus equals MB/BMW and yet in the next we're told that MB/BMW's higher status helps them sells more cars at the top end.  I mean it can't be both.  Either Lexus is equal to Mercedes/BMW in the prestige/status game or they aren't.  At 17 years of age and only one true high-end vehicle I say they aren't even close in overall position, but they are still highly regarded for sure.   VW doesn't have the pockets to make such a major distribution investment and the competition is way too fierce. To see that latter point just look at Lexus vs VW in sales. Lexus outsells or nearly outsells the cheap brand and before too much longer will outsell VW and Audi combined. It's also why the Phaeton was such a waste. That money should have been put into Audi for a greater UD dealer network and a much better looking dealer network. All the marketing in the world is worthless without a foundation investment and Audi lacks foundation in much of the US. Hence it's perception will always be lacking. Much of it's sales is highly regionalized to the northeast and over time more and more AWD offerings from the big three in the group will cut into that market share. Again I agree with most of this, but the reason I brought up VW was because of the instance by OAC that a HELM is sedan not a ""marque"" as the thread header says.  If we're going by what a sedan costs and the category then that puts VW in, though we all know that the VW brand isnt' a HELM. This inclusion of a brand based on one car was the flaw in that theory. That is what I was pointing out to Oac.  Again, I agree with much of what you've said here. I've never had a handling problem with the lsand despite all the MB handling comments on the board over the years I find that there is virtually no difference between an SClass and an lsin handling and agree with syswei that the S has gravitated more and nore toward the lsin the last few years. Impossible because if that were the case the S would have worse handling and the car has only gotten better in handling especially since the 2000 model vs the old tank 1992SClass.  All cars have gotten quieter and more refined over the years, its called progress.  There is no way the S has move in Lexus' direction while all the time the lswas becoming basically a copy of theSClass' design with the LexusLS. When you ape an entire bodystyle that is more than ""moving in a direction"" of your competitor.  The SClass always put luxury first even back in the day when it was only an SClass and a 7Series so saying the S has moved closer to the wannabe S, when the wannabe lsgot it's mojo from the S in the first place doesn't make sense to me.

" If you look at my original post, I never claimed that Lexus has out-innovated MB specifically in SAFETY since 1990. I did claim that, since 1990, Toyota/Lexus innovations IN TOTAL are at least as significant to the industry as MB innovations.Really? Would you please provide a list of Toyota/Lexus innovations, in total, since 1990 that make them ""at least as significant"" to MB innovations? For all of MB&#146;s 120 years of safety innovations, does the SClass actually end up safer than the 15-year-young LS? Actually, not according to real-world data. Check the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety website...you&#146;ll find that the lshas 16% LESS personal injury losses than the S (46 vs 55 based on 100 equaling average injury losses?both are very safe, but the lsis clearly SAFER).Wow, this is probably the most inaccurate and misleading post I have read in a long time. First of all, you can't compare numbers for cars in different classes. Notice how the SClass is rated as a ""very large"" car and the lsis a ""large"" car. Secondly, the injury loss rate is of little to no value when determining the overall safety of a car, ESPECIALLY when the numbers are so close as is this case.  Driver demographics, location demographics and a certain degree of randomness all affect these numbers. For example, I think it would be fair to assume that the lsis more likely to be driven by older, more experienced drivers. The S on the other hand, has greater appeal to hotshot young males with money, who like to drive fast and recklessly. Who would you expect to drive into a tree more often and with greater force?And you still haven't been able to explain away the following, since Lexus is such a safety conscious brand and all:-Lexus doesn't offer rear side airbags on ANY of its vehicles. (Standard across MB line)-Lexus doesn't offer rollover protection on its SC430 convertible. (Standard on the SClass since 1989)-Lexus doesn't offer rear head airbags on the IS or GS. (Standard across entire MB line)-Lexus doesn't offer head protection airbags on its SC430 convertible. (SL does)-Lexus doesn't offer standard ESC on its IS300 (Standard across entire MB line since 1999).-Lexus doesn't off rear seatbelt ETDs or load limiters, except on the lsand LexusES. (Standard across entire MB line).-Lexus doesn't offer emergency telematics on any vehicle. (Available across entire MB)-Lexus doesn't offer battery disconnect/fuel shutoff. (Standard across entire BMW line).These are just a few of the safety features that Lexus lacks in comparison to MB vehicles. Not to mention the fact that the safety features that Lexus does have, were all introduced several years after MB. I have to disagree here. You seem to take fatalities as the measure of a carmaker&#146;s worth to the world. What about fatalities due to pollution? Do you recognize that hybrid power trains, once more widely adopted (including by the Germans, once they &#147;copy&#148; the technology), will save many lives due to fuel savings and hence lower emissions? Well, I guess if a 56% reduction in single vehicle fatalities due ONE of Mercedes' countless innovations isn't impressive to you, I don't know what would be. I can't discredit Toyota/Lexus for their work with hybrid technology, but this technology is still in its infancy and isn&#146;t even an economically sound alternative to regular fuel engines. I&#146;m not sure that hybrid technology really qualifies as a &#147;safety feature&#148; more like an environmental feature. When the IIHS issues a report that hybrid technology accounts for a 56% reduction in fatalities, let me know. MB's U.S. product line actually starts LOWER in price than does Lexus'. If you eliminate all of MB's models at price points higher than Lexus' highest price point, Lexus still outsells MB in the U.S., only by a wider margin. MB product is available in the entire Lexus price range, and then some. Why can't MB outsell Lexus if price is the barrier? I&#146;m not sure where you got your numbers from, but all I had to do was visit the Lexus and MB website to disprove this theory. Here are the following BASE prices for competing Lexus and MB cars:S430: $77,970LS430: $56,225SL500: $92,020SC430: $63,575E350: $50,770GS300: $38,875ML350: $38,670 RX : $36,025C230: $29,970IS300: $30,280With the exception of the IS, every Lexus vehicle is significantly less expensive than base Mercedes vehicles with no options.  As soon as you upgrade the engine or add some options, the price difference soars exponentially. So essentially, yes there is a price barrier? a HUGE price barrier.Some value needs to be accorded MB's higher prestige. If a Timex watch were physically IDENTICAL to a Rolex, except for the brand name, don't you think Rolex could still price somewhat higher, but sell the same number of units as the physically same but lower-prestige Timex? No I don&#146;t. First of all, Timex watches and Rolex watches aren&#146;t identical, much the same as MB and Lexus aren&#146;t identical. Second of all, even if Rolex did price its watches &#147;somewhat&#148; higher than a Timex, it still wouldn&#146;t sell as many as the lower priced Timex. The greater the price, the less willing consumers are to buy any particular product, as is the case for watches or cars. I&#146;ve already shown you that MB vehicles are much more expensive than Lexus, so this effect is only magnified. Since MB has more ""content"" in the form of prestige, it follows that consumers should be willing to pay a little more but still buy it in the same numbers as Lexus. But they don't. Again, consumers aren&#146;t paying &#147;a little more&#148; they are paying on the order of 10k-30k more for BASE MB models compared to loaded Lexus models. Adding options and engines to MB models only exacerbates this difference.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Do you not see how labor costs, supplier costs, and production efficiency play significant roles in car pricing ? Excuse moi....

And since I don't live in my car, the few times I need to drive it, I enjoy driving regardless if its in luxury or sport mode... That is a good question!  How many times are we going to hear this about TPS and why an SClass costs more than a LS?

The bottom line is that the lshas been cheaper than all of its European rivals, especially Mercedes which typcially is the priciest of the entries in the segment.

The QX like you stated has hit the skids in several areas while the Lexus LX (though outdated) is pretty much an icon compared to the QX.

Lexus is also set to introduce that LF-A sports car while Nissan dealers get the car that Infiniti should be getting as their respose, the GTR.

" KBB, ALG and the Blue Book:  What further stats do you fellows need to understand that BMW is number one in residual values? Well, let's start with the fact that ""KBB"" and ""Blue Book"" are the same - what do you think the BB stands for?But I'll try one more time.  Let's start with the assumption that the car you drive - a 3Series - is a great car; most would even say the best in its class.  It probably has excellent residuals, and in terms of units sold, could certainly put BMW's ""average"" residuals way up there.But if you are buying a car in the group covered on this forum, the 3's residual is irrelevant.  The only BMW model that is relevant here is the 7Series.So even though it should be blatantly obvious to everyone that historical data shows the LS' residuals are better than the 7's, let's do this one more time based on Edmunds data, which is supposedly based on ALG data on projected residuals (see the 2/12/04 press release on ALG's web site that announces it is providing info to Edmunds).Edmunds.com has a section called Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).  They do exactly what we all agree is the correct way to determine residual value (although they do it using ALG's 5 year projected depreciation, rather than historical data).  They use current TMV (True Market Value) for purchase price, and the projected private party sales price for disposition price, with the difference being depreciation.So using the Edmunds/ALG TCO data, a 745 can be bought for $77,409 and is projected to depreciate $44,257 over 5 years, therefore retaining 42.8% of original cost.  An lscan be bought for $61,698 and is projected to depreciate $34,501 over the next 5 years, for a 44.1% retained residual.I think I have now shown conclusively that both on historical and projected data, the lshas better residuals than the 745.  But some folks here won't accept it anyway. There certainly may be reasons to prefer the 745 over the LexusLS, but residual value is not one of them.Oh, by the way, TCO for the 745 is $1.11 per mile vs. $.96 for the LexusLS.  And for those who are interested, it's $1.15 for the MBSClass, $1.22 for the 4matic version.  The Audi A8 and Phaeton both run $1.12; the Jag XJL is $1.01.If nothing else, we should all be able to agree that the lsis the value leader in this class, both up front and long term.

" Let's ask this again: What exactly do you guys constantly harp on as ""performance"" ? is this about suspension setup, steering and/or road feedback, speed, or what ?? You also add ""handling""... Is the MB better at handling than an ls? And sayz who ? Is the MB a better performance car than the ls? Sayz who. The last comparo of record was the MT Dec 2003 report for MY2004 releases. The LexusLS won that comparo, while the SClass came dead last... or close to last. And pls note that the S didn't come last despite its better performance against the LexusLS.... If you have to ask OAC then I really don't think you'll get it. Seriously.  The LexusLS I drove keeled over at the mere thought having to corner or change directions on the course that LEXUS provided.  Granted that previous  SClass was no BMW 7Series, but the car remained flatter, the steering has more feel and a Benz has always felt rock-steady at speed. These are things that Lexus doesn't seem to want to do with all the of the lsmodels up to this point. The seats in a Mercedes are more supportive, the LexusLS seats in particular are appallingly flat and church-benchish. Its all that about the steering, brakes, seats, stability in a car like the LexusLS vs. theSClass, A8 or 7Series that germancarfans talk about here.  Ask the ones that have recently bought an SClass or A8, Tony and Sam, they'll tell you exactly what I'm saying having owned both cars. Performance  isn't just a straight line which is what I think a lot of Lexus fans seem to think here with all the constantly rattling off of 0-60 times, especially since they aren't going to drive like that anyway, its silly really.  Performance is the whole package, something Mercedes admittedly doesn't do as good as BMW, but does better than Lexus. I guess its easy to always throw the ""performance"" and ""handling"" shpeel out there as things German cars are always better than Japanese cars... It's simply become an acceptable fact to be announced everytime whether its actually true or not.It is, but you wouldn't see it that way because how a car stops, steers etc. is seemingly lost here if the numbers don't put the German car ahead of the Lexus.  Just because a car might put up better numbers in certain tests (especially handling) does not mean that the car feels natural doing those things.  Neither a Lexus or a Mercedes is a BMW, but a MB is closer than a Lexus is when it comes to the SClass and the LexusLS.  No one saying the SClass is a sport sedan. Note: There was a time when Cadillac had tuned and worked on the previous fwd Seville to death, getting it to the point where it could outhandle aEClass or A6 and could hang with a 5Series through a slalom, but in the process it would shave all the tread off of its tires and the body control was gawd-awful.  Numbers only tell part of the story. I have yet to read of an lsthat tipped over taking a corner way too fast bcos its handling was terrible. Ok, you've lost the plot with that one.  Modern cars don't ""tip over"" unless you've done something terribly wrong, especially a German car or any other car of this class.  I said the LexusLS I drove at the Taste of Lexus felt  like it would tip over, not that I could get it do that on that course, but that feeling doesn't lend any substance to the lsbeing on equal dynamic footing as the Germans in this class.  It isn't. Does the ls's 278HP not best theSClass's 275HP ? Always.... Put a Z-rated shoe on the lswith the Euro suspension, and pit it against an S with dynamic suspension and the crap on it, and let's see which car outshines the other.Old news and to add insult to injury Lexus dealers know their customers don't care about handling because a LexusLS with the so-called ""Euro"" package can't even be found. Talk about an answer to a question no one is asking!  Until Lexus can produce the car you'll never know, but there is nothing to indicate the Lexus would win over a ABC equippedSClass, anyway this is all old-news and we'll have to see who the new S and lsstack up. Hmmmm ! The likes of JDP, CR, etc are mere nuisance in the industry then, eh ? If buyers and auto execs don't care about what these companies provide, why do they even exist ??? They must not serve any need in the business, right? I'll let you answer that one.... For the indusrty of course they matter, but again you missed the point.  My point is that obviously it isn't the holy grail like Lexusfans make it out to be otherwise no other brand would be able increase sales or get a new product off the ground with such a bad rep.  The previous SClass was trashed soundly in these same surveys for years, yet the new one is selling like hotcakes, obvously not every cares about and worships CR/JDP resports like Toyota/Lexus fans do.  Range Rover and VW buyers really couldn't care any less. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numbers of dealers is no excuse. What does this have to do with Audi? Audi isn't run like Lexus (you'll like that comment). Audi struggles with an image problem and for its worth the A8 has sold much better since the 2004 model arrived. Again, this is why I think it is downright careless to point to sales as the final determining factor on how good a car is.  There are many things that go into who sells what and how many.

" Lexus has core competence such as RX, LexusES and lsthat account for 70-80% of total sales volume and never need heavy discounting, whereas MB does not have a single model line that can hold its price up through a model run, some heavily discounting shortly after introduction. That is indicative of massive prestige loss . . . in more technical and relevent terms: massive loss of brand equity. This is one is so good I had to reply twice.  This (grand excuse) lets the previous GS and IS off the hook for being sales slackers because they weren't ""core models"".  Also, this seems to imply that every Lexus has held to MSRP throughout its entire production run.  That is plain bs brightness.  Every car on the market goes through the same cycle of being hot and then decline with some discounting at the end of the production run.  Lexus is no different.  The only thing that differs from brand to brand is how the maker controls the supply of model at the end.  Some will try to flood the market with units (even add models like MB did) and others will cut production to keep from having to resort to discounting. Lexus will slow down production or an outgoing model like the LexusLS and then their fans here will act as though they're hot sellers right up until the end, nevermind that they're selling less units, like the LexusLS is this year.

" Maybe you'd like to list all the innovations MB has brought forward since 1989 ? And stack them up against Lexus' in the same period... Let's see who wins... Sure, it will easily be Mercedes-Benz.  Lets see since 1989, Mercedes had done stability control, active roll-over protection (something Lexus has no clue about on a 60K SC430 while a VW Bug has the same feature as a 95K SL550), brake assist, curtain airbags, just to name a few.  The only innovation Lexus has brought to the table is hybrids and that was done on Toyota buyers first to test it out.  Lexus doesn't innovate squat, they wait for Mercedes and all the rest to do it. Pls include well-integrated into the list.Everything I named above has been well integrated and test over and over in the real world and it works, so much so that every other luxury car company around today uses it. Mercedes-Benz the innovator, period.  Lexus don't do squat in that area. Do you recall your post commenting on how many electronic features MB are removing from their newer cars just to reduce the electronic gremlins afflicting them ? And that was only circa 2005, or thereabouts... If you don't recall, I can find it for you.... its right here on this HELM board. Of course there was an article from a MB engineer about this, but again you missed the gist of the story by a country mile.  Mercedes did remove unnecessary electronic functions from their cars, not the entire removal of any one particular system. A lot of pre-determined settings and other things that customers wouldn't understand unless they read the manual were removed. Things dealing with pre-sets for the sunroof and things like needless features in the Comand system. BTW, that is you that doesn't remember what you wrote a while back, not me. Obviously you are wrong here. For starters, the affluent class has EXPANDED globally in recent years. Many more people can now afford to own/lease luxury cars, and you see the evidence all around you, and in luxury sedan sales growth.Obviously you don't know what you're talking about here; this doesn't apply to every single person in the luxury car market. 86K is still 86K and 58K is still 58K. Not everyone leases either.  Secondly, a car like MB with so much more attributes than its competitors should be selling in droves, despite its higher price (heritage, class, features, performance, etc).Well the SClass is, but at 90K a pop it won't and can't last forever, there aren't that many buyers out there at that price point to keep sales at the current level forever.  Again, prestige/status doesn't mean anything if you don't have the money to buy the car that has it. I don't see what is so hard to understand about this.  If price didn't mean anything they why the hell does Lexus consistently low-ball the entire class with the LS?  They do this to add a PRICE ADVANTAGE to their resume. Besides, its not like most SClass buyers pay cash for a $90K product. They mostly lease.Stats please?  Facts, not speculation. What percentage finances the difference or buy with cash vs. leasing?  I don't suppose that if I can pay $900/mth on an ""inferior"" LexusLS, I will be easily scared to pay $1200/mth for a ""superior"" SClass.You would if 900 bucks a month was already a reach, and you have no way of knowing the entire world's financial situation.  Again, not everyone leases. Real-world pricing/leasing knocks your argument down, Merc1. Common sense obliterates yours because you don't seem to be able to either produce the numbers about who leases vs. buys or understand that never every luxury car buyer leases in the first place.  There are folks right here on these boards that will tell you that they buy a car like this and keep them for a long time, these folks don't lease. Finally, MB is priced higher BCOS ............. its cost structure is higher, not bcos the car is better. Yeah sure, that must by why people still pay more for MBs and while Lexus can't even get more than merely competitive in more than 2 segments.  Makes sense.  If Lexus were so much better wouldn't they be the king of every segment they compete in?  Wouldn't the American consumer see this stunning Lexus superiority by now?  Oh, you'll say that they're the best selling luxury brand, while they pedal ES/RX vehicles at price under 50K while the bulk of MB's lineup is price above (sometimes way above) 50K.  Yeah that is an apples to apples comparo. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" MB is not as cost efficient as Toyota just as Toyota is not as cost efficient as Hyundai.

Hmmmm.... could it be bcos they are NOT willing to pay bigger bucks, especially where there is a very comparable or better car in the ls???  I gave you an example of the LC v LX470. Loaded, a 2006 LX470 retails for $70K. A loaded 2006 LC retails for $60K, a $10K difference. Yet, the higher priced LX470 sells more units than the lower priced LC. Meaning: people will pay for quality. There is a real quality difference b/w these two trucks. If theSClass/500 are that much better than the LexusLS, people will gladly pay the higher price, and MB should sell lots more than the cheaper LexusLS.

" MB starts at 29,970, Lexus at 30,280. MB's product line BRACKETS Lexus' in price. If Lexus ran 30-70k and MB 50-140k you would have a valid point on price. But MB starts slightly lower.So let me get this straight. You think that because the IS costs $310 more than a C230 that Lexus cars are less expensive overall than MB cars? What about the fact that a base E350 costs nearly $12,000 more than a base GS300?  What about the fact that a base ML350 costs $2645 more than a base  RX ? I don&#146;t know why you even bother to bring the option issue to the table because it just proves my point. Not only are base model MB&#146;s more expensive as a group than base model Lexus, but adding on options to both MB and Lexus only widens the gap! Look how high the gap is already between several loaded Lexus and base MB models:Loaded ls: $66,339BASESClass: $77,970Total Difference: $11,631Loaded GS300: $46,034BASE E350: $50,770Total Difference: $4,736Loaded GS430: $54,724BASE E500:  $58,520Total Difference: $3,796S vs LexusLS. lsis often cross-shopped with the E, not solely with the S. You can find examples on these very boards.The base E500 costs $2295 more than the base LexusLS.  The loaded E500 costs $10,495  more than a loaded LexusLS. How do you explain that?SL500 vs SC430. What about the CLK and SLK?The base CLK500 costs $62,920 and the base SC430 costs $63,575. A loaded CLK500 costs $79,139 and a loaded SC430 costs $65,748. The $600 price difference between the base models is insignificant, but the $15,564 price difference between loaded models is significant. &#147;The greater the price, the less willing consumers are to buy any particular product.&#148; You forgot to add the qualifier &#147;all else being equal&#148;. Because if there is suitably higher content to go along with a higher price, the higher priced product need not sell in lower units.Just because MB model X has more &#147;content&#148; than Lexus model Y doesn&#146;t mean that people will opt to pay more for the MB. Some people may not be able to afford the 16,000 price difference between a loaded CLK500 and SC430. Even though they might rather have the MB, the Lexus is a cheaper alternative.Prestige is valuable, and, other things equal, if one product has more prestige it can command a higher price. PRESTIGE IS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER &#147;FEATURE&#148; OF A PRODUCT, such as larger engine, better styling, etc?insomuch as people are willing to pay extra for it.True prestige is valuable. This is partially why MB can sell cars at a higher price than Lexus. MB makes its profits by selling fewer cars for more money. Lexus makes its profits by selling more cars for less money. Which economic strategy is better is irrelevant because we&#146;re only talking about why Lexus sells more cars than MB.Suppose there is a housing developer who is building new homes on a large tract of land. Suppose that he offers only two models, &#147;m4&#148; which has 4000 sq ft on 1 acre, and &#147;m5&#148; which haSClass0 sf on 1.25 acres. You are saying &#147;The greater the price, the less willing consumers are to buy any particular product.&#148;?meaning that it is impossible to sell in the same quantities if one is priced higher. I submit that if m5 is priced only slightly higher than m4, say 5%, then it will not only sell more units (directly opposite what you suggest), but it will probably sell MULTIPLE TIMES as many units as m4. Similarly if the developer tries to price too much for the extra content, say 45%, then m4 will outsell m5 by multiple times. If follows that there is a some price premium between 5% and 45% where the two will sell in EQUAL numbers, DESPITE m5 being priced higher. I don&#146;t know if that premium will be 20% or some other number, but the important point is that if a product has higher content, be it size or prestige, it can outsell even a lower-priced product.I understand your analogy but I don&#146;t believe that it accurately applies to Lexus and MB cars. MB cars don&#146;t just cost &#147;5%&#148; more than Lexus cars. MB frequently costs 10k more than a Lexus and in some instances, MB costs several tens of thousands more than Lexus. The price difference isn&#146;t so small as to invalidate the basic economic principle of the demand curve. So you can&#146;t use price as an excuse for MB&#146;s US sales performance, because there is an offsetting factor at work: prestige.  Prestige is a positive factor in MB sales; however, price is an extremely negative factor for MB sales in relation to Lexus. I have already shown that Lexus vehicles, on average, cost more no matter how you calculate it. Lexus costs more base vs. base and Lexus costs more loaded vs. loaded. Also, I don&#146;t have any numbers in front of me at the moment. But I&#146;m fairly certain that the only reason why Lexus outsells MB in the U.S. is because of the RX300/330.

" Merc says that people are noticing and praising Audi for its interior quality and technology innovations. I'd like to see the sampling of the buying public that agrees with that. Edmunds is a very small, narrow, viewpoint of the whole market. Most of us are car junkies.... The real world buyers are nothing like us... So I suspect Audi's interior quality and technology hasn't helped it much, but with the VW albatross on Audi's neck, little wonder it has had problem gaining traction (no pun intended) here in the NA market. It may well be too late for Audi to gain any respect, unless Lexus stumbles badly, and Acura and Infiniti fall off the face of the earth.

Only the front seats of the LexusLS have side airbags to protect the torso, whereas MB and BMW offer these bags for both the front and back seats across their entire model line. Additionally, MB offers standard seat belt ETDs and force limiters for rear seating positions across the entire model line. Lexus only offers these devices on the LexusES and LexusLS.

" My point was that many people in my circle do NOT want an MB, and it no longer holds the mystique it once held, at least for people I know. ANd the sales factoids backed up that assertion, hence I quoted these for you, just in case you don't believe me. It is crystal clear that less people buy MBs today than they buy the competition, especially Lexus. Yet you continually do not want to connect the dots between MB's downward sales trend relative to its competition (esp. Lexus) and its fall from grace showing it is NO longer the *must have* car for the high-end lux buyer. Bingo!  That is your circle, but the sales numbers still say that MB is the #1 choice for the high-end buyer any way you want to slice it.  Whether or not you agree with it or not, whether or not it is deserved or not, it is what it is.    It the same thing about my circle when I said most people I know see Lexus (except the RX) as being an old man's car, but actual proof was given showing that overall Lexus buyers are younger and MB's.    My perception of the brand didn't equal the reality.  Same thing with your statement about MB and high-end buyers.  You stated that 50-80K is the proper price range and that is where MB rules and the numbers I gave earlier prove it.   That doesn't even include the SL, CL, SLR and various high-end AMG products.  You can't make the judgement about MB not being #1 in status or high-end sales if you're only going to look at some of what they sell.   When Lexus comes out with similar high-end versions of the next LexusLS, and that sports car you'll all of a see what I'm talking about.   All of a sudden the price range that matters will become wherever Lexus tops out at, be it 100K or whatever.  Or, put it this way...if Lexus comes out with a 85-90K version of the next lsit outsells the 750Li and  SClass that won't matter because its over 80K?  Or will you then stretch the price bracket to include that Lexus? Look at it objectively. How can MB be the #1 brand when it sells way less than its competition ??? According to syswei, extrapolating from YTD numbers, Lexus will outsell MB by a whopping 40% by year end !!! Easy, because overall sales aren't the end-all like you make them out to be.  Sales is just one component of status or prestige, which is what I'm saying MB is #1 in, not total overall sales.   You are switching up between who is number #1 in prestige vs who is just #1 in sales, and it isn't the same thing.  You put sales as the #1 thing just because Lexus is #1 right now.  Now if Cadillac passes Lexus in sales will that make them a more prestigious brand to you?  Most likely not.  Then you'll  look at other aspects of the prestige question.  You down play price like it doesn't matter.  Mercedes sold over 13K SL's last year for at least 85K a pop.  Now if you're going to get into a subjective thing like status then you have to look at everything and not just a simplistic look at who sells the most overall.  You may choose not to see what I see, and choose not to infer what I infer... that's your choice. My point is clear and backed up with those sales factoids either YTD or going back 6 years.... Problem is you haven't given any factoids about MB not being the #1 choice for the high-end buyer, only a bunch of irrelevant things about sales overall, which wasn't the issue, nor is what you've given the sole indicator of prestige or status.  You also ignore that over those 6 years you keep talking about MB went from 100K to over 200K in sales, at higher prices overall than Lexus, but to you price doesn't matter.   I mean all luxury brands should grow at the same rate no matter what their prices are?  That is being ""objective""?If you want to say that Lexus is #1 sales all day long, no one will disagree, but the majority of those sales are the LexusES and RX, both sub-50K vehicles.  Those are not high-end products, which is where I disagree with you about MB not being the choice brand, not overall sales. Again, if you have the numbers to prove that MB isn't the #1 choice for the high-end buyer (which you estimated to be between 50-80K), and/or that someone else is,  I'd love to see them.

Imho, it could  be priced at that level and still perhaps outsell the 7 (though offseting the factors you mentioned the 7 will still have the advantage of better...to some...driving dynamics, and despite the survey someone posted could in some people's eyes have stronger prestige/cachet).  That still doesn't prove that Lexus from a corporate standpoint should price it there.  Why do you assume that you know better than Lexus what the profit-maximizing price strategy really is?  Have you conducted your own surveys or focus groups?  These companies do have focus group studies....I was even invited to what was described to me as a ""luxury sedan"" focus group, but unfortunately had a business conflict so didn't attend.Maybe it is the Germans that are over-priced, not Lexus that is underpriced.  Have you thought of that possibility?  That if the Germans had lower production costs than they do in the real world, their profit-maximizing strategy might be to lower their selling prices, not maintain them?Do you understand the concept of price elasticity of demand?

" No one here is under the impression or illusion that smart business doesn't sell cars. The key is to satisfy both sides to a degree like Porsche or BMW does...So you are essentially asking Toyota to be who they are not ! I mean, how can you fault a car business running on auto pilot as the Toyota/Lexus machine is currently on ? They have their DNA in the market, just like you correctly noted for the LS' stellar sales success - sterling reputation for quality and reliability. And that reputation makes them successful... Why change that formula ?Every successful company must carve out a niche/calling card/DNA (call it whatever you like) that the market buys into. BMW has the performance/handling, ditto Porsche, Lexus is the other extreme, solid build quality, reliable machine, and luxurious to boot. Somewhere in the middle (to one side or the other) are the likes of Audi, MB, Jaguar, etc... Some are very successful at it, others struggle at it. Toyota sells cars that MOST people want, not ALL people. Fact is BMW and Porsche COMBINED do NOT have the profitability, market share and share size of the juggernaut called TOYOTA, despite making cars that benefit the so-called performance-biased crowd.... Sucks, but its the truth. Personally, if I were Toyota, I'd be careful to making too many wholesale changes to my DNA... Don't want to upset the applecart, you know...

No where in any review did they say the car had handling equal to any of the Euro cars.

It seems Lexus is indeed getting serious about performance as they've showed an RX350 being hustled around a racetrack by a professional driver with the poor owner to never know what it is to drive his vehicle. A very good look, and huge step foward for Lexus as they've showed the atheleticism of the 3.5L V-6 engine in the commercial. Now to the Q7. The ad pretty much sucked. No arguement out of me on that one Doc and LJ. They could've done much better than that. The A8 when new for '04 ad was vastly better, albeit they stopped showing it after 1 year. I did however just watch a new Q7 ad featuring a ""4-Seasons"" type layout, which undoubtedly zeroed in on the quattro system and the trick 4-level air suspension, which did get some interest out of me.

" noticed that there were some discussions about the purchasing power of lsbuyers, and what I found to be interesting was that if they are truly an affluent group, why then do the Lexus buyers seem to have an obsession with resale? Would they actually NOT buy a car they otherwise like because of the mathematics of resale?BINGO!Your observations are dead on. The reason is  the lsup to now is not priced like German HELMs but more like German LPS like the 5/E/A6 models. Therefore the lsattracts a different segment of the market  . A market that consists of buyers that are more conscious about resale values than in the market for HELMs. Although the future LWB and Hybrid lsmodels will sell at real HELM prices.I include myself in the above category.  I did buy my BMW 530xi Touring because it is IMO the most driveable family wagon out there.  But another consideration was BMW resale values (I was quite impressed with the the  price I sold my 99 BMW323i).The only HELM auto I would ever consider buying is a Porshce 911 Carrera S. Unfortunately the Carrera S MSRP in Canada is at a  40 percent premium (adjusted for foreign exchange) over over the MSRP in USA.RIP OFF! Pride refuses me to be lured into such a transaction.

Secondly the ""S-Class"" isn't just one car, it is a group of cars and to beat the SClass you have to have something at the top to compete with the upper models, which is why Lexus is going for their faux ""LS600h"" to do battle at the upper end.

" Neither IS nor GS were intended to beat 3, 5, C or E on their own. IS and GS were performance extensions of LexusES and RX mainstream cars. LexusES and RX competed against 325, 525, C240, C280, E320 and their wagon variants; IS and GS competed against 3Series , 530i, 545i, C320, and E500. If anything, one might make the argument that BMW and MB copy each other's product lineups, replete with almost one-on-one sedan and wagon offerings, whereas Lexus took quite a different route. All spin and bs not really worth responding to.  The IS and GS you say - ""were performance extensions of LexusES and RX mainstream cars"". Dude that is so ridiculous it doesn't warrant a response.  Totally ridiculous. Is that your way of backtracking what you said earlier?? But you are the one spreading the ""rumors,"" whether that rumor has any substance or not. No, it was a way of clearing up what I said earlier, since you didn't seem to grasp it.  Secondly, anything I've said about upcoming products can be readily found in the press and I didn't pass them off as fact, only speculation.  In stark constrast to how most Lexus fans report things. AMG is obviously an MB attempt to copy the success BMW's M division. They compete for the similar clientelles; just look at the numerous comparos. Your argument splitting hair about AMG using AMG and force-induction therefore it's not copying M division is laughable . . . by that logic, Lexus never copied anyone because it packed more electronics, electronics that actually worked, into their cars. Get real. Bull, plain and simple.  AMG goes back to 1967 and BMW's M wasn't even a matter of discussion back then.  AMG has always been about hp more than outright handling like M.  The original AMG ""Hammer"" proves this.  It wasn't a M5 competitors on the track, but would inhale it on the straights. More importantly, my point about copying was that AMG isn't trying to build a BMW in either function or look like LEXUS DID with Mercedes in the past or Lexus now.  Big difference.  You get real and realize that Lexus is all about chasing whomever they think is hot at the moment, that being BMW now in their eyes.  Every car add electronics, not just Lexus.  Every car DOES NOT however have to look like their most direct competitor.  Adding the electronics bs to your post was only more of the same spin as before.  There is no point for anyone else to make an lsexcept for Lexus; nor anyone to make an SClass except MB; nor anyone to make a 7 except for BMW. However, if you can make a better lsthan Lexus, or better S than MB, or better 7 than BMW, and still be able to sell with a competitive value proposition, you have a business plan. The reality is that, nobody in their right mind dares to even try making a better lsthan Lexus. The same can not be said of S (or CLS, like you said ealier). What a pile of contradiction.  The lsstarted out as a copy in the first place!  Have you forgotten this?  For MB to set out to make lsthey'd only be copying SOME of their own previous work and BMW and the rest aren't interested in doing so because a car like the lsdoesn't suite the profile of BMW, Jaguar or Audi.

" Oh, so we should do this by number of innovations rather than their importance to the industry? OK, let's play it your way. Just visit the USPTO site and see how many patents have been issued to Toyota vs MB since 1990. Answer: Toyota 4906, MB 1998.Yes but the question is how many of these patents were for worthwhile technologies. I would consider MB's patent for ESC of greater value than a Toyota patent for a new keyless entry remote. The sheer number of patents means nothing unless you know what the patents correspond to. Also, how do you know that 1500 of those Toyota patents aren't related to one complicated part, like the hybrid drive system?In fact, larger size should help not hurt MB's S injury rates...as can be seen in the data, where the average ""very large"" car does better than the average ""large"" one.Actually larger vehicles have more kinetic energy in collisions, so in a single vehicle crash, lighter (and well engineered) vehicles will fair better. Larger vehicles only have an advantage in multiple car accidents. This is generally the case for all cars, although a well engineered large car will certainly fair better in a single vehicle crash than a poorly engineered small car. The point is the larger size of the S isn't always an advantage although I guess it would be generally. It doesn&#146;t matter anyway because this data is an inaccurate indicator of vehicle safety when the numbers are so close. Your statement might be true if the average age of an S driver were 22 and the average for Lexus were 40, but I think you know better than that. You can't come up with hard numbers and neither can I. My guess is that average for both cars would be in the area of 45-58. IF it is higher for Lexus, do you realize that this would imply a greater number of people over, say 65, who may drive slower but also have slower reaction times and hence might be more accident-prone?Neither of us can provide any hard numbers. But using intuition alone it is easy to understand why an S (or any other MB for that matter) would appeal to a younger, more reckless crowd, in addition to the older crowd that the LexusLS caters to. But again, neither of us can show evidence of this... The bottom line is this: the IIHS injury data doesn't account for age, gender or personality demographics. Location demographics and a certain degree of randomness also play into this. The difference between the two cars in this particular measurement is so insignificant, that you really can't say either way given all the unknowns. However, I would argue that MB is safer because it incorporates more safety features into its cars and has a solid heritage as a safety leader.But Mr. tiag_m5/jovialanus somehow left out part of the C&D comparo: the LS's ""Acceleration is brisk: second best to 60 mph; third in the quarter, at 95 mph, as it showed taillights to three of the four Germans. Yet its fuel economy on our trip tied the Jag's at 21 mpg, topped the Audi's, BMW's, and Benz's by 2 mpg&#148; Wow, so it got second place in acceleration. That doesn&#146;t outweigh the fact that it had the longest in class stopping distance, which in itself is a safety flaw.  Also, you&#146;re kidding yourself if you think different tires would have significantly affected the ls&#146;s performance. You might see a slight improvement, but nothing significant. It&#146;s also interesting that C&D included a pre-refresh MB SClass without the new 7 speed transmission and chose the smallest engine available, theSClass, when a more fair comparison would have been the SClass.

" Oh, wrt the new LS460, so far I have stayed on the sidelines reading everything before commenting. I wanted to read many opinions and see lots of pictures. Appears that overall, MORE people like it than not. That is good. Me, I got my check in hand now. My search for a replacement for my '99 lsis over already. The newly styled LS460 SWB with its 380bhp, mid-20 mpg, 8-speed tranny, auto park, smart card, 7.1 DTS 19-speaker ML, 8GB of HD space for 4000 songs, etc.. etc... has me won over. Another car that should give the Germans fits... And the class redefined all over again. Especially, if the $3K lift of base price over 2006 LexusLS rumor turns out to be true. Can the 335hp S450 touch the LS460 ? I don't think so. Can the 382  SClass touch the LS460 ? Yup. But it will be a battle indeed. The lswill continue to outsell the SClass again, only this time, the sales gap will grow even larger. My prediction... What's yours ? Oh I'll give you the car is very impressive, moreso the technology than the sytling.  The interior looks more or less like a GS or IS with more buttons.  The exterior lost something from the original concept IMO.  The LS460L in particular looks unbalanced to me.  Yes the lswill continue to outsell the SClass I'm sure, but of course a 3K price increase will still put the LS460 under 60K, while a S450 will cost at least 78K. But according to you this won't make a difference so why even bring up sales?  A cheaper car in this segment is going to sell more, common sense to me. On paper at least the LS460 makes the S450, 750, A8 and XJ all seem pointless, but the proof is in the driving and real world evaluations.  I don't really see anything unique besides the 8-speed tranny when the lsis compared to theSClass. The new SClass has a new fancy sound system of its own along with a PCMCIA card slot for storing songs, 1500 song capacity I believe. Unless the driving experience is better than the LexusLS, the LS460 will only win over those already sworn to Lexus, IMO.  The styling is already a let down IMO. BTW, the Audi A/S8's new B&O sound system might end being better than either MB or Lexus. I seriously would question who is using your ID if anything from Lexus didn't win you over.

" paying a lot more money for a vehicle that is .5 - .9 seconds faster than it's more archaic clone is not a value to meFunny how the MB website proclaims about the new-generation M-Class, ""A New Era of Power Begins""...yet the 2006 ML350 still trails the archaic  RX  by .4 sec, 0-60, and the RX400h by .9 - 1.3 sec.I always find it amusing when germancarfan ""enthusiasts"" downplay acceleration times.  Somehow I imagine that if Lexus edged MB in handling, but trailed in 0-60 times, the germancarfans would be downplaying handling and emphasizing 0-60 times.Do you sell MBs for a living?  How do you sell your customers on an SClass instead of a S350, or a  SClass instead of anSClass, or an SClass instead of a SClass?  Adjusting for equipment other than the engine, MB is still asking for $thousands for each jump up, and $tens of thousands for the jump to theSClass.  Yet this is ok in your eyes (and I assume you do your best to encourage customers to pay up for the hp and torque)...and somehow its not ok to pay for the performance and fuel economy of a hybrid?I'm not the type to pay msrp or higher and I won't be buying a hybrid until the next lscomes out, but hybrid is definitely worth some premium over a plain ICE...just as an  SClass is worth more than anSClass.

So strange that all of sudden MB,BMW, and Audi are getting hammered on performance models of the big cars, but why did Lexus say that the ""600"" will have the performance to hang with the ""big guys""??

Well said, blkislandguy....There are lots of reasons why the lssells at prices lower than the comparable S. The lsis produced cheaper than the S (the legendary TPS comes into play here), the lsdoes NOT yet have the 110+ years of heritage/marque of the MB brand, and more importantly (IMO), the MB is pretty much over-priced for what you get. On the latter, it may play to owners ego owning a high-priced MB sedan, however, the reality is that MB's (C and E) average selling prices are at or lower than comparable Lexus cars (ES and GS), except at theSClass. If Lexus had half as much history and heritage as MB, it'd sell at far higher premium at the HELM level... In time, Lexus will be higher than MB. Check out the GS and IS prices, they are already at or in some cases higher than comparable BMW and MB sedans...

" Re: the SCvs. the SL, part of the reason for the HUGE success of the SCis the SL-matching V8 within the Sc430 engine bay. Whether the Lexus built the SCto compete with the SClass primarily, at $25k less is debatable. But the SL, for 3 years, would struggle to outrun the Lexus. I'm sure this was used in ""walkarounds"" often. Won? Won what?  The bottom line is that the SClass is the better car and has been since day one.  For all the speed matching potential you claim the SC430 has it can't use it any way other than in a straight line since it has little to no handling compared to the SL.  Again time to update the rant, the SL550 will easily dispense with any SC430s that dare act like they have any ""sport"" in their DNA.  Doc, the SClass is a better car than the SC430, period.  The SC430 scores last and the SClass wins any and everytime they've faced each other. GAME OVER. THE END. Re: the original SC, having been knocked-off several times (Mazda MX-6 and Buick Riviera the most blatant), and being called, at $45k, ""Possibly the best car on the planet!"" by C&D, the 1992-99 SCresume wants for nothing. It had to be re-engineered to bring the latest safety equipment cars started to bear in '95+, and Lexus had other plans. Not a one of thoese cars even looks anything like the Lexus SC, especially the Buick.  Buick's copy target was Jaguar during those days not Lexus.  The last part about the SChaving to be re-engineered is a nice, grand even, excuse.  Toyota has more money than anyone else and can ""engineer"" a car to meet whatever standards they want.  Period. As Mercedes CLK has ALWAYS shown, matching style with the original SCwas futile, so just slap two doors on an E, and call it a day!First off the CLK isn't based on  EClass  and how do you know that Mercedes was trying to match the SC400?  The fact remains that the original CLK from 1998-2002 saw the SC400 off the market, as to which looks better we will agree to disagree there.  Not knocking the original SC400 either, I liked the car myself, but it wasn't heaven sent like you portray it to be.  Considering Mercedes had several years to build an SCcompetitor, the 1999 CLK430 was another weak effort, hoplessly derivitive of  EClass  sedan, as was it's forebearer.Fact check, the 1999 CLK430 was NOT derived from  EClass .  It was derived from the C-Class platform, unlike the previous 300CE/E320 Coupe which was derived from  EClass . Since you brought up the CL (Comparing it to cars costing half as much smacks of desperation, Merc. You know better!), if Lexus built cars that cost as much as SClass, SL550, or CL55, you wouldn't be so apt to hide in an Ivory tower. I'm not comparing the two cars as a whole, only their styling which the CL blows away any Lexus, still to this day.  Talk about desperation at least I can point to a current Mercedes that has some looks and not live in the past about a car long since out of production, that my friend is desperation in trying to cover for the current SC430's lame duck styling and driving experience.  The SC400 does nothing for the SC430. Mercedes better have an anwser for the 600h! That could be 10-12k sales a year, by itself. No doubt the car will be a hit, but why is that Mercedes is the only one that has to ""come up with something""?  Mercedes won't have a direct answer for the LS600h, as will no other manufacturer.

BMW and MB don't make a vehicle that targets the ES330!   MB's acquisition of AMG was a direct response to BMW M's success. See how you spin things out of context?  Nobody said anything about how, why or when Mercedes bought out AMG.  The topic of discussion was about copying, which AMG doesn't do when it comes to BMW's M when it comes to the cars they produce.  Period.  If they did Mercedes would be offering manual trannies and they surely wouldn't be making an AMG version of an SUV or crossover vehicle.  The topic was about the cars, not why Mercedes bought AMG. All this talk about Lexus copying others are just old claptrap nonsense from sore losers. Carmakers copy from each other all the time, since the day the wheel was invented. Lexus does not set out to copy leaders; they learn the success of leaders, and set out to overtake leadership. That's something MB is really terrible at. Look at MB's R class, 203"" vehicle length but only 82 cu.ft interior space. Apparently the company does not even deign to learn from its own Chrysler division. All this spin and denial about Lexus copies from the market leaders is just more of the same in the way of excuses for people who can't accept the fact that Lexus learns from, but can't help copy from also, from those same leaders. All this BS about ""core competence"", ""Lexus ran out of staff"" (!) and lumping sales of completely different vehicles are definitiely signs of sore losers who can't accpet the fact that Lexus hasn't hit a home run everytime out the gate.  Nothing more than grand excuse making at its very, ill-concieved best.  The part about Lexus running out of staff is the most ridiculous thing I have read on here since reading how theSClass/760Li aren't luxury cars. Brabus?  Most here don't care about or grasp the meaning of AMG or M type cars so bringing up an even more extreme outfit like Brabus would be utterly pointless to say the least. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Shall we talk about the free fall the LexusLS is doing this year? Of course not because common sense tells us that it is going to drop like a rock with all the newer competition on the market so you harping about the C's sales smacks of desperation to the highest power. The ls's *free fall* in sales is nothing to do with its competition but more to do with its pending model change over. You should know that, Merc1... Lexus has one of the highest owner retention in the industry... Many owners are simply waiting on their hands to buy the LS460 and its other variants... When you see the new LexusLS, why would you not wait another 5 months ???Yeah I said the new LexusES is ugly, it is as ugly as all getout. The right adjective here would be IMO... A car as successful as the LexusES clearly has a lot of things going for it. It is the clear and undisputed leader in its sector... Its not even close... You don't have to like it, but to categorically diss it like you do smacks of hate and lack of objectivity. You simply have a one-track mentality of cars... they should drive like they are on a track otherwise condemn them to the scrap yard... Get real !            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" So the only way Lexus will remain a threat to BMW is when Lexus cars become like BMWs and that is just not going to happen(assuming Lexus knows what is in their long term interests)! My o my ! Are we living in rose-colored houses or what ! Lexus cars to be like BMWs ??? Gotta be kidding... Since when did BMW become the sales benchmark for Lexus to emulate ? BMW lives and dies on sales of the 3Series... Way too dependent on a single model line, don't you think ? OTOH, Lexus makes its hay on the GX, RX, LexusES, LexusLS, and increasingly the IS.... Far more successful lines than BMW. It may hurt your Germancarfan pride to see how Lexus continues to cream most BMW in sales, must be that most buyers prefer Lexus to BMW, isn't it ? Maybe those buyers don't know/care squat about the drivability of a BMW, eh ?            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" So you are essentially asking Toyota to be who they are not ! I mean, how can you fault a car business running on auto pilot as the Toyota/Lexus machine is currently on ? They have their DNA in the market, just like you correctly noted for the LS' stellar sales success - sterling reputation for quality and reliability. And that reputation makes them successful... Why change that formula ? Nope not at all. I don't see why everyone who champions Toyota/Lexus thinks that making an exciting car will ruin the business end. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact if Toyota/Lexus started to cater to even a few enthusiasts their business would grow even further.  Nobody is asking them to change who they are, only to remember that not everyone wants a sensible shoes transportation appliance in every category.  If Toyota made a 350Z killer, a 35K Supra that looked great along with all the other positive attributes the previous Supra had I'd have one in a min!  How is that hurting them?  It isn't. Every successful company must carve out a niche/calling card/DNA (call it whatever you like) that the market buys into. BMW has the performance/handling, ditto Porsche, Lexus is the other extreme, solid build quality, reliable machine, and luxurious to boot. Somewhere in the middle (to one side or the other) are the likes of Audi, MB, Jaguar, etc... Some are very successful at it, others struggle at it. Sorry Oac but this doesn't hold any weight because Lexus doesn't hold anything ""extreme"" in the areas of solid build quality or luxury over Audi, BMW or Jaguar or MB, they're just more reliable.  Those ""others"" as you say thrive in areas in which Lexus doesn't so it isn't nearly black and white as you imply with this statement. Toyota sells cars that MOST people want, not ALL people. Fact is BMW and Porsche COMBINED do NOT have the profitability, market share and share size of the juggernaut called TOYOTA, despite making cars that benefit the so-called performance-biased crowd.... Very lopsided and downright silly to compare BMW and Porsche's balance sheet/market share with Toyota's.  Uh...of course Toyota is going to make more money and have more market share than a luxury car maker like BMW and of course they'll do better than a small high-end sports car maker like Porsche...both brands sell cars for prices Toyota (and Lexus) can only dream about.  However since you brought up Porsche, you should know that Porsche makes more money PER CAR SOLD than any other car company in the world.  Period.  BMW is also in the top 3 of this group. I'm not talking about the dollar amount, but the percentage of profit/return on each unit.  Porsche is #1 in the world at this.  If you're going to compare BMW and Porsche's financials overall to anyone it has to be Lexus, but does Toyota break out the financials for Lexus seperate from Toyota?  Probably not.  While we're talking about market share, why not look at what percentage of the sports car market Porsche has or the luxury car market that BMW has.  Yes I know you'll say that Lexus is #1 here, but BMW isn't a one-market-only-wonder like Lexus. BMW's board likely couldn't be more pleased with their success. Ditto for Porsche and Honda too for that matter. Personally, if I were Toyota, I'd be careful to making too many wholesale changes to my DNA...You just don't get it Oac, no one is asking them to make wholesale changes to their DNA, only to remember that not everyone wants a sedan or suv.  In the past Toyota has made cars like the Supra and Celica and MR2 and up until recently those cars were successful and it didn't hurt their business one bit.  Surely the super smart Toyota could change some things around with those models only in order to grow their business that much more?  If they can't then they're the biggest one-trick pony in the business.  Don't want to upset the applecart, you know... Maybe Merc1 needs a trip to Harvard Business School to better understand what makes Toyota a runaway success it is today... I am sure it will change his perception of Toyota/Lexus forever... Again, the point has been missed here. What on earth does this have to do with the cars sitting on the showroom floor?  No one buys a Toyota or Lexus because of their stellar business practices, though I know certain Lexus/Toyota fanatics here would like to think people do but they don't.  Others have proven that you can run a succesfull, heck a highly successful business while catering to the enthusiast and I'm not even saying that is what Toyota/Lexus should do, they only need one or two models to help shed some of the stick-in-the-mud image.  If you get the sensible shoes buyers and the enthusiasts in the same showroom buying different products you'd have the market truly cornered!  Even LJ can see that. There isn't a place on earth that I could visit outside of a Lexus or Toyota showroom with some or at least one stunning vehicle that would change my perception of Lexus or Toyota.  Again, having solid business end (Porsche or BMW) doesn't mean you have to have dull cars, Lexus' business would grow that much more if they had something, hell anything that lit the fire of an enthusiast.  Keep the yawners like the LS/RX/ES true to form, but their is no reason why the GS, IS and that upcoming sports car have to be so dull and yawn inducing.  This implication that a solid business can't be had while appealing to enthusiast, in Toyota/Lexus' case just a little not a wholesale change, is just total nonsense.  Toyota has managed to do just that before even conservative types like Honda manage to do it.  If Honda can do such with a cars like the S2000 or Civic Si that blows this (Toyota) theory about good business has to made or can only thrive on boring cars right out of the water!All this about Toyota being a runaway success is a double-edged sword because there is slow buildup of evidence that Toyota's lock on reliability/quality is slipping right along with all this success (increased production).  cont....

" So you are saying a single  SClass model is enough to hold off the LS460, LS460L, LS600hL, 7Series, 7SeriesL, A8, A8L, XJ ?? No, does it look like I'm saying that?  I clearly stated that I don't think it would be the right thing for them to introduce a S450 RIGHT NOW for the reasons Tagman and I mentioned before.  Mercedes doesn't have to ""hold off"" the lsnor could they as far as sales go because we all know the lsis going to be cheaper.  You missed the point entirely it seems. MB needs another one to supplement the  SClass pretty quick. By next spring, the LS600hL arrives here, and MB suddenly has 3 lsseries sedans to battle against using one SClass, or maybe a possibleSClass. Nonsense. They don't need anything ""pretty quick"" because as it stands now the  SClass is selling a rate not previously seen for theSClass.  The point is as time goes on and the competition increases they'll start to add more variants which is no different that what MB and BMW for that matter have done for years and years.   And I don't count the very low volume S63/S65 here. You don't have to as far as your sales theories go, I mentioned them because these are variants that MB will build - point being they'll have enough already without adding a S350 CGI like Tagman hinted at. This whole ""who will be tops in sales"" thing is really irrelevant until either Lexus prices like MB (which I'm not suggesting they do) or until MB drops prices to compete directly with Lexus.  We all know the Lexus will be thousands cheaper and common sense says it should sell better especially that SWB LS460 which won't even be close to a starting price of the current SClass.  If there were an S450 coming for this fall it would have been at the NY show like all the other MY2007 updates were.  So as it stands the price of entry to the ""S-Class"" will be around 87K (for now at least), likely 20K or more above the price of where the LS460 will base at.  M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Someone else, I think it was in R&T, described the ls's handling as greasy so they are at odds. I fully agree with Merc that the lshandles like a boat and is numb.First, let me remind people that although I don't have as many cars as blkhemi (but then who does?), I have owned BMW, MB and Audi cars in the past (and still own 2 MBs).I spent the last weekend driving from DC to Philly and back (attending a funeral) with my family in my '05 LexusLS.  This car does not have the ""impossible-to-find"" Euro suspension, but does have the 18"" all-season low profile Dunlop tires.Real world test:  everyone in my family (one front seat and two rear seat passengers, and me as driver) enjoyed the ride.  The GPS worked great getting us around without any maps in unfamiliar places (used the override sequence to enable changes in Destinations while driving - a must do!), the ride was smooth and quiet, the brakes worked beautifully in the one accident avoidance maneuver I had to make, and the seats were comfortable (even for me who has a very bad back from failed back surgery).  It did not handle like a boat, and the steering on my car is extremely tight - if anything, it takes more effort than I might like (this may be a function of the sticky 18"" tires).I admittedly rarely go more than 10 mph above the speed limit, so 75 mph is more my reality than 110+ mph on the Autobahn.  I could understand why someone in Germany would choose an SClass or 760 0ver an lsfor that reason, but I don't live there.The only knock I have on this car is the uninspired styling (interior and exterior). But looks like even that will improve with the upcoming LS460.If I were going to drive aggressively at high speed darting in and out of traffic (like one person I saw on I-95 yesterday in a M45), I'd go with hpowders' 545 or a tuner version E or 5Series.  I certainly wouldn't choose an S, an A8, or even a 7 for that.  But the reality is I don't want to drive like that.  I do like to take corners relatively quickly, and my lsactually does that better than my E320.  Sorry, merc1 and Tagman, at least shod with performance tires, the lshandles very well.  Drive one with these tires (but without the ""Euro suspension"" which is how they are coming to the dealers these days), and I think you may change your one-note tune.  But of course, even more relevant for the future will be how the LS460 handles, and NO ONE HAS DRIVEN ONE YET!Hey, I am just thankful that I, the grandson of immigrants who came here with nothing but the clothes on their backs, have the right and the capability to choose among these fine vehicles.  Ain't America great!            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Sometimes though you guys make it seem like the S (and Mercedes itself) is going to all of a sudden stop selling because of the new LexusLS, that is nonsense. Me thinks so... Nahhhhh !!! just pulling your legs... Lighten up, will ya !Not discounting the business end, just saying that it isn't relevant to us talking about cars. OK... I hear you...You'll be unhappy to know that the GS is already down in sales just a year after introduction. That Infiniti M that you claimed wouldn't matter in the sales race due buyers not wanting a sportier car in that segment has managed to outsell your GS last month. I seem to remember a lot of hype this time last year about how the GS was going to do so much and yet its already hitting the skids. Go figure. I have said it many times I am no GS fan, so this does not really apply to me... I test drove the new GS300 and M35 when they both came out, and if you recall my test drive write-up on the sedan comparison board, it showered lots of praise on the M35. I loved the car and so were my kids who begged me to buy the car right there... (they came along for the ride)... Yes, the M is a better car than the GS.... currently. However, to its credit, the new GS came hobbled - 245HP GS300 (too low) and 300HP GS430 (carry-over motor) - knowing there was a GS350 and GS460 due within 18 months of the March 2005 release, may have something to do with its declining sales after only 12 months in the market. If I know I can get a 315HP GS350 in a matter of 6 months from now, why would I buy a 245HP GS300 ? And if I can get a 380HP GS460, should I pony up the $$$ for a GS430 ? Think the market does not know about the new GS twins coming real soon ? Even Lexus expects it to be so... Especially with an IS350 with 306HP (actual 325HP on old SAE standards) selling cheaper than a GS300... The mid-cycle refresh for the GS couldn't come any sooner...            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Sorry, Doc, I truly do believe that to move Lexus even faster than they are already moving would be ""hazardous to their health"". Gotta agree with tagman here. Lexus is not under-priced. MB is over-priced. The pricing of the next lsshould not be focused on theSClass. Instead, Lexus should consider the purchasing power of the marketing and cost cutting through better technology and management. If Lexus keeps on delivering good cars at a justified price, then MB has but only two options:1) lower it's price and compete head on2) raise it's price and follow the steps of Rolls RoyceP.S. I sure hope Lexus build cars in China. In that way, we may buy an ES350 at $25000 or an LS460 at $50000. And yeah, kill the competition.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Still speculation for now, but something tells me MB is not thinking like you. They will see the LS600hL as a direct competitor to theSClass. The LS460L is a match for the SClass/7SeriesL, so expect the 600hL to go right against theSClass/760iL/A8L... Don't think so ? Just wait and see... Yeah we'll see because as of right now 430hp ain't gonna cut it against theSClass, IMO.  If they price it like a SClass then maybe, but we know they won't do that.  I suspect the LS600h will be a 100K car, not 140K.  I'll even give you that in a sense or in most people's mind it will compete with the SClass because they're calling it a ""600"" too.  I won't get into what I think about that, but of course many will shop both cars, but let me be clear it is the performance is where I don't think the LS600h will be able to keep pace with theSClass. Now a G SClass sounds good, but what would it compete with?  Gonna have to be hella powerful to contend with the E63 or M5. Nah I think you'll see a GS460 with 380h to compete with the 360hp 550i and 382hp E550. The GS450h isn't produced in enough numbers to replace the GS430/460 in that space.

" Talking about MB, it is a highly prestigious brand, no doubt, but what I was saying is that buyers today have more choices when buying high end lux cars than in the past, say decades ago. And the increased wealth in the US certainly provides the fodder for many to afford all sorts of luxury cars. WIth Audi, BMW, Lexus, Infiniti, VW, etc... MB can no longer dominate the lux space as int he past. Decades ago?  Whats the point?  This is common knowledge that from decades ago that MB isn't the only choice in town, they never were, only the most popular one for the high end buyer, which was the point of your original post.   Lexus wasn't even around ""decades ago""?   MB is still the most prestigious out of the mainstream luxury brands either way you want to word it.  BMW and Audi have always been around so I really don't get what you're trying to say here, and Mercedes has held prestige over them every since.   BMW can't sell anything past the 7Series in price and they've tried twice in the last 15 years with the Z8 and 850i, both came up short.  You say that Mercedes can no longer dominate the luxury space?  Then who does?  Or we need to determine what is the luxury space?  Is it 30K on up or it where the real luxury cars are, imo somewhere around 60K and up.   Between that point of where the mid-size luxury cars taper off, around 60K or so to somewhere over 100K Mercedes is dominant.   Audi and Infiniti have big time trouble selling anything over 60K, especially Infiniti.  Lexus has but one sedan and a coupe that sell for over 60K, and the SC430 doesn't break 70K like the LexusLS does.    BMW does a lot better above that point and Mercedes is the clear leader there so I don't see any basis for your point, it seems like reaching for something that simply isn't there, at least right now.  For the high-end buyer some type of Mercedes is still ""the car"" whether that ranking is deserved or not.  Between the CLS, SL, CL, S, and other various AMG models Mercedes moves more high-dollar hardware both here and around the world than anyone else in the mainstream luxury sector.  Sure when you talk about Aston-Martin, Bentley, Ferrari and others Mercedes is not as prestigious and can't command the same prices.  The 450K SLR is a rare thing.  Even I, as much as I like the Mercedes CL or SL, would take an Aston-Martin DB9 over either one of them.   No one here has seen the new S in person or the lsat all so there is no way for anyone to know how the cars will match up in person.  The SClass sales of the last few years are supposed to drop,  its a 7 year old car.  Even still it outsells all the Euro competition in the U.S. and around the world, only the much cheaper lsoutsells it, and in this country only.   That to me says Mercedes' prestige or dominance isn't even in question.   When the SClass or  EClass  for that matter lose their positions both here and around the world then you may have a point.  In the lower ranks its BMW who is red-hot obviously with everyone chasing the 3Series, been that way for years.  Mercedes was never the dominant choice when it came to their smaller cars.

" Tell me, Merc1, what do MB and BMW have that Audi does not have ? A 12-cylinder super sedan ? Sport-biased cars ? Racing history ? Heritage ? Even sales on a global basis.... When you mention MB/BMW, pls include Audi. Audi is as much a HELM company as MB and BMW ! Ditto Jag (gotta acknowledge Blkhemi and TagMan's request here). Only Lexus needs to be propped into the HELM class on the strenght of its lssedan. As Lexus adds more to its upper cadre cars, it will become a solid HELM company - lsseries, GT450, and potentially another super sedan above the 600hL... Audi doesn't have the product spread that BMW and especially Mercedes-Benz has for one.  Audi is rapidly changing this and of course they have nearly everything else MB/BMW has so you're right, but when I said that Audi wasn't a a HELM I was thinking primarily in the U.S. market.  Audi as it stands in this country right now they only have one HELM car, the A8/S8/A8L.  As far as propping up a brand with one car that competes in the HELM space, Audi is pretty much in the same boat as Lexus in that regard, but you're right their other qualities put them nearly equal footing with BMW and Mercedes-Benz but that disqualifies Lexus outright because they have none of those other things you mentioned in regards to Audi.   Trust, you don't have to build Audi up to me because I think they're 90 percent as good as anything BMW/Mercedes makes.  They just don't have the lineup at the moment and they realize this as does Lexus.  Everyone does bottom 2 sedan categories and most do the S/LS/7/A8/XJ segment, but even fewer do the convertible/sports cars/roadster segments like BMW and especialy MB. Lexus on the other hand doesn't have anything even remotely interesting outside the sedan category and even there they lack any real lust objects.  There is no way possible you can be a High-End Luxury Marque with just one car (a sedan) that competes at the true high end, otherwise VW is also a HELM too and we all know they aren't.  That is why this:BTW, the word ""marques"" does not imply a brand with more than one marque car, but rather more than one car company with at least a marque car that fits into the HELM topic on this board. doesn't fly.  Marque does indeed mean a brand not just one sedan that barely gets past 70K which happens to be where BMW and again, especially Mercedes have no shortage of models competiting or any trouble selling.  Otherwise the thread needs to be changed to High-End Luxury Sedans, not Marques. As Lexus adds more to its upper cadre cars, it will become a solid HELM company - lsseries, GT450, and potentially another super sedan above the 600hLTrue, but in the NOW Lexus don't cut it as a true HELM.

I can see why some of them would fall in love with a Lexus, but there are others here (outside of your circle) that come back to MB after the Lexus experience gets too boring. BTW many of these people also have moved to the RX, the GX, the LX, the GS, have picked up an LexusES for their spouse and now an IS (or SC) for kids or as a toy. But keep on thinking it's only the lsdoing the job if that is what you want to think.Good for them, this can (and does) happen with any buyer that discovers a new brand and has a good experience with it.  Keep thinking that the majority of Lexus owners are former MB owners.  Those days are over and the only Lexus model that really did (or does) any converting is the LexusLS.  People trade all types of cars in on other brands, but with Lexus it was always the lsthat brought in the highest percentage of MB owners.  The other Lexus models don't attract any more MB owners than they do any other brand.  You could stop the average GS,ES,RX or LX buyer and I bet they didn't own a Mercedes before, but with the lsyou'll get more that did. This about all of Lexus' models getting the ""job done"" means what?  What 'job' is that?  A mass exodus away from Mercedes?  Yeah sure. The main reason a MB owner would trade to a Lexus is reliability, not the way the car drives, provided they could actually tell the difference in the first place, which I'm convinced some in your circle were clueless about if they find the LexusLS to be the best ""driving car they've ever driven"". Wish I knew what that meant exactly, but I'd guess it is all about silence, nav and sound systems being perfect rather than anything actually relating to how the car actuallly ""drives"".  Just my guess going by what I see written here about why a Lexus is so good. Lastly, if some Germancar buyers are willing to sacrafice some relibility for a better driving experience (not riding experience which is what most of Lexus' biggest defenders talk about) then the reverse is true. I've read it here before from Lexus owners, they'll give up some of the driving experience, style etc. for a more reliabile vehicle.    M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" the C&D comparo started with a disclaimer that the lsis not the type of vehicle usually reviewed by the magazine, to me means take the finding with a huge grain of salt. Really ? I would have thought the opposite, cos like many Eurofans here, these mags have their biases as well and would not have thought to expect a floaty, luxo-cruiser, snoozemobile like the lsagainst the likes of the 745, A8, andSClass. Who would have thunk dat ??? I see how hard it is for any of your Eurofans even to accept that comparo. Figures...            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The Corolla did indeed do better, but these cars still did worse. It doesn't look like a definitive conclusion here. Despite what anyone says, there is no hard data to confirm what either party is saying.The reason that the Elantra, Forenza, Spectra and Beetle received poor ratings despite the airbags is because of their structure. I understand that structure play a crucial role in the performance of a vehicle in a crash. But it seems to me that airbags are just as important. A car with a good structure will still perform poorly in a side impact if it doesn't have side airbags... just the same as a car with side airbags will perform poorly without a good structure. For the sake of simplicity, we'll hypothetically assume that the structure of the lsand the S are the same. With a side airbag, you're going to suffer less trauma to your torso and pelvis than without. If that isn't an admission what is? You're comparing someone wearing Reeboks to ballerina shoes...This isn't rocket science...BTW Euro Sport is a no cost option, whereas the  SClass is a 30K price difference. I still don't think C&R would shame themselves and completely discredit their own review by saying that it was unfair. I do remember the quote you were referring to, but I thought it was little more than a disclaimer... after all, they did award first place to the car with lateral grip worse than a Silverado. Even if the lsdid have the sport option it certainly wouldn't be any BMW. Lexus' approach to ""sport"" isn't exactly impressive either. Someone needs to post the full performance specs from the CR review with the SClass and LexusLS w/sport...  The Euro-Sport package costs $220, not to mention you won't be able to find one anywhere. The difference between the SClass and the  SClass is roughly $10k, and some of that translates into more standard options aside from the larger engine. I just hope Mercedes drops the 430 from its lineup and puts the 500 as its base when the new S comes out. It wasn't impressive at all. If I remember correctly the CD changer was still in the trunk as well. I didn't see what is so ""Athletic"" about it. Maybe the  SClass is different, I didn't drive it so I don't know.Having the CD changer in the trunk is a very minor detail in my opinion. I would rather have the rear side airbags and forgo the convenience of an in dash changer. You probably didn't see what was so ""athletic"" about the S because you didn't push it. With the ABC sport mode activated and ESP off, you'd be surprised how fun the S can be to drive. For $78K you are getting more because you are paying more! Compare a $71K LexusLS Ultra to get a better idea of value.Well there are a few more optional features on the SClass that aren't available with the LexusLS... Granted you do pay more. The $7k difference between the LexusLS Ultra and the SClass is justifiable enough for me. I don't mind paying a bit more for the added safety, performance and style of the S regardless of how large or small the difference really is. If reliability and value were what I was after I would get the LexusLS... Different people have different priorities I guess.Maybe BMW has the highest residual value overall, but the LexusLS has the best in class one of 64%. So not only does it cost less, it holds its' value better too.I don't mean to nitpick but according to ALG the Mercedes-Benz CLK has the best resale in the ""luxury"" class. Granted the lsprobably does have the best residual out of the S, 7, A8, etc... Just an FYI.I think you will all agree spending $60K on any car is not a fully ""Logical"" decision. So it is no surprise we see alot of emotional debate on this board.Amen.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The fact of the matter is that I'm still content on what I like, just like most of the G-car fans here. You like to ride, I like to DRIVE. No biggie, just differences of preferences.Ride v Drive, eh ? I believe I do DRIVE all of my cars fairly regularly. I also do hitch a RIDE with a friend or business associate once in awhile.... Is that what you meant, BlkHemi ?BTW, what will be the difference b/w driving an a8 and driving an LexusLS ? Both have four wheels, four doors, a steering, powerful V8 motors, 6 cogs, etc... The a8 is plush, longer wheelbase, beautiful interior, and a tad slow compared to its peers. The lsis plush, shorter wheel base, beautiful interior and ergonomics, and as fast as its peers, even with the smallest displacement. Excessive road noise, and high NVH ain't fortes for HELM cars. All of these HELM cars have similar attributes with small differences - marketing, brand, and perception - in the buying public domain.Let me answer my own rhetorical question about a8 v ls: mostly suspension/wheel setup.

"                No one said anything about the abolishment or demise of Lexus. Lexus is here to stay and we all know this.Re-read the post and you'll understand that all was said was that Lexus is not immune from deficiency. You can't make this into one of your Team Lexus shouting matches.Talking about something that should've never came across the Pacific, the laughable ES250(circa 1990) and the previous-gen IS300 was an inert attempt by Lexus to encroach on the market by offering mal-performing cars at cheap prices. Witness the GS, a car that went from '98 to '04 without a single major update(besides a upgrade from 400 GS430). The new GS needs: A new engine, a touter suspension, and styling revisions already? This from the makers of PERFECTION? Paaleeeesssseeeee. Appalling to say the least. Lexus even admits that it had to do this in order to stay competitive(or lack thereof) with the E/5/A6. Still, if it had to be Japanese, the M35/45 walks on it all day long...            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety would probably disagree with you. You seem to ignore that frame construction is the Number ONE factor whether it be an airplane or car.Wrong. That article mentions that a good structure is necessary in addition to side airbags. A good structure alone simply isn't enough. Besides, why does it matter? You talk as if Lexus has a better structure than Mercedes when there is plenty of evidence that points to the opposite. Notice he's saying the same thing I am: Structure is key. Had any of you had an engineering background like I do, you might understand that. An Airbag isn't going to compensate for a lacking structure.A strong structure isn't going to compensate for lacking an airbag either. Assuming that Lexus has a strong frame will never compensate for the fact that they penny pinch on vital safety features like side airbags. Again, I would argue that MB, BMW and others have some of the strongest structures available. For example, if you look at the IIHS crash test details for large luxury cars and luxury SUVs you'll notice that BMW and Mercedes usually have the lowest crush levels of all comparable cars tested. With the BMW X5 ""Measured intrusion into the compartment was less than in any other vehicle we have tested."" How's that for structure for you. On the other hand, Lexus is still having problems with a weak structure/safety cage on the  RX . You've already read in prior posts that the LexusLS structure is studied at various engineering schools. The LexusLS scores equally well in every objective measure out there. You offer opinions, yet I have facts to back up what I say. Not that I wouldn't mind the extra airbag, but it's not going to make a major difference as shown in the results I've posted above. What are you talking about? The LexusLS has been tested in ONE objective test for a frontal impact at 40mph. As I have already explained, crash tests are nice but they don't reveal the whole picture. There are an infinite number of real world crashes that Lexus is never held accountable for. You have no idea how the LexusLS would perform at a higher impact speed, a different offset width, a different angle, roll over, etc. The comment about engineering schools is nonsense to say the least... You offer opinions, yet I have facts to back up what I say. Not that I wouldn't mind the extra airbag, but it's not going to make a major difference as shown in the results I've posted above.But you haven't provided any facts. All you've done is tried to mitigate Lexus' disregard for safety. Contrary to what you said, that link above shows a MAJOR difference in crash performance. Of the cars with ""good structures"" like the Corolla, just look at what a difference equipping optional side airbags made in its performance. Before the side airbags the driver of the Corolla would have sustained life threatening injuries. With the side airbags, the driver would have walked away. Now imagine this impressive difference applied to back seat occupants of your LexusLS and you'll understand. You're still taking that comparo out of context. Go back and read the article. They did say it wasn't a fair comparison, and likened the LexusLS to wearing slippery ballerina shoes if I remember the quote correctly. And No, the Lexus never scores dead last in anything. It's usually in the higher end of straight line acceleration and middle of the pack in other performance realms. You can bluster all you want but even the Autorags give Lexus it's due.Everything you just said is blatantly inaccurate. Nothing I said was out of context. Again, read the article, Car and Driver NEVER said the test was unfair. Why would they discredit their own review? That doesn't even make sense. Second of all, YES the LexusLS DID score dead last for overall performance. It only scored well from 0-60, but in every other aspect, the LexusLS score well behind the rest. Give me a break, the lshas lateral grip worse than most pickup trucks. 18 inch tires aren't going to magically whisk the lsfrom worst to best in class... It simply isn't possible. You didn't even answer my question... why can't I compare an  SClass with an LexusLS but you can compare a Euro-Sport lswith anSClass?I've driven a SClass and no, the difference was not huge. The SClass was stripped of options for $78K (List price). The Navigation system wasn't close to that of the LexusLS. Lexus has been using a DVD based system since 2001, MB 2004. As far as electronics go, Lexus is much better no contest. The Benz looks better and feels marginally better on the highway at 90 MPH. The Lexus has better resale value.The difference is huge though. I won't argue with you that the S is more expensive because it obviously is. All I'm saying is that you get that much more out of the extra cost. Also, you're wrong about the Navigation system. DVD navigation has been standard on the SClass since 2003 and navigation is still optional on the LexusLS. Not to mention that the SClass is more athletic than the lsby ten fold. How are electronics no contest in Lexus' favor? Mercedes offers all of Lexus' features and then some. And as long as you brought up resale value, I would like to point out that BMW has the highest luxury residual value.You keep harping on about Innovation...My answer: We don't care who built it first. So as long as it works. Basically you're making the snob appeal argument, that's what it all boils down to.The only reason I mention innovation is because it represents the priorities of the company. With Lexus, the priority is reliability. With Mercedes, the priority is obviously safety as can be seen by their dominance in this area. And it isn't even just innovation... you refuse to accept that Lexus has fewer safety features and is slow to market with new innovations. No one is making a snob appeal argument... I simply pointed out the facts and you refuse to accept them as valid for some reason. Sorry, I don't buy my car as status symbol to brag about. I think that perfectly illustrates the difference between Lexus owners and Mercedes owners.Wow, that was a pompous and snobish statement if there ever was one. It's the same reason I wear a Seiko instead of a Rolex. Reliabilty is better and it does the same exact thing...So why spend $10K for show?Apples and oranges.  <            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The 1998-2005 GS was an experimental entry to a new segment for Lexus. The car certainly did better than R-class upon introduction. Heavy discounting started only 3-4 model years after introduction unlike the R-class. Frankly, GS sales did/does not matter to Lexus, unlike  EClass  to MB. Now this is desperate brightness.  The 1998 GS was an expirement, but the 2006 R-Class isn't? What bs, not to mention a big-fat-excuse for the 1998 GS having flopped after the 2000 MY because the 1998 GS was the second generation of the GS, hardly a new segment/experimental car like the R-Class is.  The R-Class isn't replacing a current Mercedes, unlike the 1998 GS did.  The first generation IS300 was an experiment, but the 1998 GS wasn't. Lexus has core competence such as RX, LexusES and lsthat account for 70-80% of total sales volume and never need heavy discounting, whereas MB does not have a single model line that can hold its price up through a model run, some heavily discounting shortly after introduction. That is indicative of massive prestige loss . . . in more technical and relevent terms: massive loss of brand equity. Yeah right, I guess the previous GS and IS were selling for sticker as is the current SC430.  You're not dealing in reality if you think these models weren't discounted or that the current SC430 isn't being discounted now.  You think the LexusLS, who's sales are dropping this year isn't being discounted at all?  Yeah right. To say that a model like the GS doesn't matter to Lexus is nothing more than a big fat excuse.

" The Lexus ""image"" IS GOING TO SHIFT closer to BMW. This will be based upon their very own model line-up, not marketing hype. One good look at the designs of their newest vehicles tells all. As I said before, the Bimmers were already out there, and NOW you see the latest from Lexus showing HUGE similarities. It is OBVIOUS that they did not by some mere coincidence come up with such similar design lines.I&#146;d like to know what you are talking about. The LF-Sh bears a slight resemblance to the LexusES which preceded the 5 and was out at the same time as the 7. Both  the LexusES and Camry are slab-sided so they weren&#146;t copying BMW. The new BMWs show so much copying that it&#146;s ridiculous. For example, the concave shoulder on the 5 is a ripoff of the Lincoln LexusLS. The Bangle butts come from Chrylser, Honda, Mazdas of years ago.The rear of the LF-Sh not only resembles the LexusES but also the Mazda Millenia. The front stands on its own. BMWs are about a lot of scar-tissue surfacing, aka flame surfacing. There is no flame surfacing on new Lexuses. Lexus is clearly trying to hitchhike onto 3Series dominance but they are not doing it with styling. Rather it is a performance appeal solely via horsepower. Let me know if you see lsadvertising going after the 7Series with flames coming out of the road like they did with the IS. It ain&#146;t gonna happen. Is there enough of a 7Series market share for them to go after it? Lexus is coming into its own niche with the LexusLS, some 17 years after being the Ultimate Following Machine. Heh, heh, that was great Merc. I&#146;m surprised you didn&#146;t use that sooner. Or maybe you have?The question is, will the new lsup the ante with handling like Mercedes did with the S. It says no here. In that regard it will be a little better than a Town Car. And it will need more than 20-inch wheels to do it. 7Series buyers want nothing to do with an LexusLS.

Nicest Japanese rendition of reliable transportation so far. I'll give you that, but give me a break, the Lexus just doesn't tend to quicken the pulse.

" The only hybrid that I know of that is in constant demand is the Prius all the others seem to range from ok to not selling wellmerc, here's how it is with the hybrids.  So far the Prius and the '06 Honda Civic Hybrid are in significant demand.  The upcoming Honda Fit Hybrid will with certainty be in significant demand as well.  What this shows is that, at least so far, the hybrid option can do very well at the economy tier.  The Ford Escape Hybrid and Toyota Highlander Hybrid and the Honda Accord Hybrid have not done well at all and there are a number of reasons.  The upcoming Camry Hybrid will prove the REAL hybrid potential in middle ground.  If it pulls it off, then the playing field is wide open.  If not, then it will show that the hybrids are polarized to the lower tier . . . and upper tier IF,IF,IF the LS600h is successful.  Personally, I believe that the lshybrid will do very well, and will establish a genuine upper tier market.  To be seen, of course.If all the hurdles are cleared and a 50 state diesel is possible MB, BMW and Audi will sell diesels in good numbers.

I have driven the current 320cdi and it is a fabulous powerplant.  The more significant question to this forum is whether or not it shows up in the S.  The next question is what progress has Mercedes made in the hybrid front?  After all, Toyota/Lexus has an enormous treasure of experience with hybrid technology.  And what car would Mercedes utilize it in anyway, and how many years down the pike, if they do something?

" The problem with VW Phaeton is that it is overpriced. No way is the Phaeton overpriced! The Phaeton is cheaper than the SClass and 7Series.  It wasn't intended from the start to compete with cars like the LexusLS which isn't a ""benchmark"" in Europe.  Europe being where VW wanted to make an engineering statement in MB's face. Selling it here was debated, delayed and then half-done.  The car was intended to be a cheaper rival to the SClass and to a lesser degree the 7Series and it is cheaper than those cars. The problem with the Phaeton is the VW badge, dealer body and to a lesser degree VW's bad reliability reputation. You're right the first generation LexusLS was cheap. If I remember right it was about the price of a 190E, around 35K base and 41K or so with the few options it had back then. No one can build a car of the lsor Phaeton's specification for that type of money in today's market.  Not gonna happen.  The Phaeton is priced right compared to its other German rivals, but everything else is off as I mentioned above.  The biggest problem is that ""VW"" stands for inexpensive cars, not luxury cars.  Phaetons can be had for 10-15K off sticker according to some on these boards, now if that doesn't sell them it has to be the badge. That and the fact that most people don't even know the car exists. Now imo if VW wanted to ""save"" the car they should bring over the SWB Phaeton with the V8 and sell it for E500/550i/A6 4.2 money.  That might interest buyers in the same way some buyers look at an E500 or A6 4.2. and then find a much bigger LexusLS far more attractive because they see the similarly priced base LexusLS as a rung up from the mere mid-size/level luxury cars.  I seriously doubt they'll throw any more money at the Phaeton at this point, but I think it would work. M            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The question is, in comparing the MB-S series, the BMW high end (whatever it's called, 700 series I think), and the LexusLS, what has been a better car the past several years, taking everything into consideration (luxury, build quality, dependability, etc., etc.)? I think that the unequivocal answer to this question is the LexusLS. You will notice that I did not even bring up the fact that the lscosts about $10-20 thousand less. That makes it even more of a winner. Now, what about the future? Is this going to change? I very much doubt it. With the gorgeous LS460 coming out and more importantly the LS600HL, I don't see how things are going to change much. The lswill still be the better vehicle, period. Isn't this the most important factor? Better when you stack the criteria in favor of the LexusLS. No where in there does performance, handling, styling or anything else that actually relates to it being a car as opposed to an appliance even come up.  Secondly this about the lsbeing more luxurious doesn't hold water.  The car is no more ""luxurious"" than a SClass or A8. Softer leather?  Big deal, it will look like crap when the 2nd onwer gets his hands on it.  Many buyers don't give a ""flying leap"" about all this dependability/reliablity superiority that Lexus defenders constantly harp about it, if they MB/BMW/Audi wouldn't be able to sell cars, and they all do it for more money on top of that.  On paper the lslooks to be the end-all vehicle to some, yet right here on Edmunds you'll find a few Lexus owners have left and some buyers that found it to be a totally insipid vehicle.

"                I fully agree with your previous post.Lexus' latest assault on BMW in regards to the IS is nothing short of amazing. Never in the company's history have they produced anything remotely close to tearing down the 3. The IS is the car that should've been here with the '00 3Series. I have absolute repect for the car as it embodies what it takes (to some degree) to be a successful sport sedan. Some tweaking of the chassis, better steering feel, higher grip tires, a more reclined rear seat and BMW may have something to worry about. This is something Lexus may correct with the second year of productionNow, if Lexus does green light the ISClass, then the M3/RS4/CTS-v/C55 AMG crowd will get some serious comp.But all is not peachy at Lexus. They still don't know what to do about the GS. First they were to give the V6 more oomph but where would that leave the V8(for now)? Then they were to kill off the V8 model completely for the GS450h? Just install the new 4.6 and call it a day to stay competitive. A complete overhaul(excluding the RX- kill the RX400h tho) of their SUV's is well overdue. The GX remains unimpressive, and the LX, altho very capable and comfortable, is dated in it's category. The HPX would serve Lexus proud.BMW on the other hand: This company knows what it's customer wants and it delivers. The i-Drive confusion(altho I don't see how it was so confusing) did little to sway it's loyalist away from the brand. With a new 3Series Coupe, the new X5, the newly introduced X7(a Escalade/RR rival), and a slew of M cars, the company has plenty to keep it's customer base happy. A refreshed 5Series in '08 should keep it inline with  EClass  and A6. And let's not forget the long-awaited 7Series for '08(on sale late fall '07). This is the car that is supposed to correct all shortcoming of the current model. With a projected first ever diesel-hybrid, a direct injected 420-hp V8, a first ever M model(finally), and a MB-beating 612hp V12 with a DCX-esque cylinder shutoff, the 7 may longer be the laughing stock in it's class.....

When you see the new LexusLS, why would you not wait another 5 months ??? Oac read the post I was replying to, specifically the Doc's rant about C-Class sales.  What you're telling me I already know and stated that in the same post Oac! I personally don't see how anyone could buy a LexusLS at this point with the 1000 times improved LS460 pending. The right adjective here would be IMO... A car as successful as the LexusES clearly has a lot of things going for it. It is the clear and undisputed leader in its sector... Its not even close... You don't have to like it, but to categorically diss it like you do smacks of hate and lack of objectivity. You simply have a one-track mentality of cars... they should drive like they are on a track otherwise condemn them to the scrap yard... Get real ! Ok, IMO its one of the ugliest cars on the road.  Is that better?  You're right the LexusES is the clear leader in its segment, problem is its the ONLY car in its segment.  There are no other fwd imports playing the same game anymore so you really aren't saying much to say its the leader in its segment.  If I have a one-track mentality about how a car should drive then you clearly have one about cars when it comes sales.  With you all that matters if the car sells or not, not how it looks, drives or anything else.  If the car doesn't sell or doesn't have the stamp of approval from CR or JDP then it isn't worthy. That is as one-tracked/sided as it gets.  For the record I don't think cars should all drive the same way. Again, if you had read my post to DrFill you would have seen why I pointed out the dynamic differences of the LexusES vs. the other cars in its price range.  As far as ""getting real"" I think you'd be wise to follow your own advice there especially when it comes to your hyping up and preaching about the Lexus brand so when called into question you won't have to go back on your  iffy claims about the competition.

" This was also nicely underscored by Lexus in their ad campaign for the RX a couple of years ago, showing ""engineers"" from what would be competitors testing, driving, and prodding every new feature on the RX. Yeah I saw those ads, but showing Italian engineers studying the RX didn't make much sense to me because nothing from Italy that I know of competes with the RX, or any Lexus really.  Especially in this country. I think there are two very distinct factions at GM.  The engineers who could do better and the bean counters that won't let them.   The problem is worse now because when GM was making the money the beaners wouldn't let the engineers spend any of it on better details so now since they aren't making any the choice is literally gone.  The guys in that article know GM is way behind and could likely engineer a better product, but now they'll never get the leeway to do it.  Then again a crisis does bring out the best in some companies and if these new full size SUVs are hits maybe they'll spend some of the profits on high-volume cars and not Corvette Z06s and STS/XLR-Vs.

" Those who love capitalism and its benefits should push for more profit increases. Lexus should gun more for capitalists who love ""commanding premium"" along with its current customer base.Let's not confuse unit profits with corporate profits.  If Lexus jacked up its lsprices by 50% it might raise per-unit profits, but unit volumes would fall enough that corporate profits would suffer.When the lswas introduced in 1989, Lexus had little to offset the established image and prestige of MB.  So of course it had to significantly underprice MB if it were to ever sell comparable numbers of units.  Something has to offset prestige in the buyer's mind, and presumed reliability isn't enough for some buyers.Over the years, Lexus has improved in prestige, and this has enabled them to narrow the price gap with MB.  But we all know that MB still enjoys a prestige advantage, so again there must be some offset if Lexus is to sell comparable or higher numbers of units.  As long as a prestige gap remains, so to will a price gap, imho.  But you will see Lexus continue to narrow that gap as its prestige improves.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" We are talkig percentages based on the Blue Book! Absolute dollars has no relevance whatsoever!!  Call it ESP but I sense a whole slew of future statistical-related posts! Dewey, if you are correct on this I for one would be surprised.  Len, I would say the true measure of residual value is not ""current resale/original MSRP"", but ""current resale/original purchase price (or cap cost)"".  Some cars typically sell at bigger discounts than others, so MSRP is not necessarily a comparable number between different brands for true original cost.On that score, if after 3 years you can sell a typical 7 for a higher percentage of  original purchase price than a typical LexusLS, I would be impressed.  To actually figure that out, I assume you could use the links to Edmunds' TMV pricing that Len gave us back in #10790 to determine what a car could be sold for now (I would suggest using the ""sale by a private party"" as the basis for current resale - that takes the dealer markup/markdown out of the equation).  Then you would somehow need to figure out what those cars actually sold for back in 2002.In my zipcode, Edmunds says the typical 3 yr old 745Li would sell for $42,029 and the typical lswould sell for $33,809.  To be conservative, let's assume the lsoriginally was bought for $55,000 (which is only about $1000 less than I paid for my '05 with Nav system, premium stereo, etc.).  So the lsretained over 61% of original cost.  For the 745 to match that, it would have had to have sold for less than $68,372.  But Edmunds says a ""typically equipped"" 2005 745Li would now actually sell for $75,978. 2005 745Li pricingLet's say that 3 years ago it would have sold for $2,000 less than in '05 (twice the amount I took off for the LexusLS, just to be conservative again).  That would mean that the 745 could have been bought for $73,978.  Therefore, the 745 has kept less than 57% of its value after 3 years.So which is the residual value leader - the lsthat retained over 61% or the 745Li that retained less than 57%?Oh yeah, I know, this was one of those ""statistical-related posts"" that you apparently think are irrelevant....

" We'll people always bashed Lexus for not having any kind of styling ""direction"" and that each car just kind of did its own thing. Now they are starting to build some cars with a ""family"" resemblance, and you're bashing them for that. What should they do? No I'm not bashing them for having a family resemblance, I'm just wondering if all the MB/Audi detractors that bashed Audi and especially Mercedes for doing the same thing are going to say anything about Lexus doing it.  Of course they aren't because just like I said when people here were knocking the A4 and C-Class for looking like scaled down A8s andSClasses, when Lexus does this it will be seen as some great styling home run.   Fast foward, and that is what happened just as I and Lexus said it would do.  But just a few years ago right here in this very board the SClass was devauled because it had a C-Class clone running around, now since Lexus has done the same thing with the lsand IS, its a smart practice.  The A8 and A4 are no different from the IS and LexusLS, now.  Both sets of cars are nothing more than a scale up/down of the same theme for both brands. Of course since Lexus has managed to make a lsthat doesn't look like poor copy of a Benz the raves are pouring in on the other board with the S being dated and what not.  Benz had better knock off 20K from the price or tweak the S before it goes on sale here, nevermind the fact that it is already on sale in Europe so it would be impossible to ""tweak"" it for the U.S. market as far as styling goes.  Such hype I haven't read a quite a while.  It's 1989 all over again and yet even in 1989 Benz and everyone else went on doing what they're going to do in 2006, sell cars.

" There's nothing wrong with comparing the production curve of any two car models. Just don't compare the first model year of one car with the winding down year of another, like what you were trying to do . . . that would be intellectually dishonest because we both know that cars sell much better in the early parts of its procution cycle. Again, you brought up the comparo between the CLS and IS/GS.  However there is something wrong with this comparo because you said that the IS and GS were successful if we're going by the 14K units the CLS sold.  This is just that, dishonest because the CLS costs way more than a GS and nearly double the first generation IS.  Secondly IN THEIR SEGMENTS the IS and GS didn't do squat in sales compared to their main competitors, BMW and Mercedes.  The CLS doesn't really have an direct competitors. It is just that, dishonest for you to leave out the other factors in the sales of these three totally different vehicles. When was the last time MB newly conqured any market segment? 1970/80's displacing Cadillac?

I guess you'll have to excuse me for not understanding why you don't see the difference between the current LexusLS, which I agree is derivative of the W140 SClass that I said in my post that I liked, and the new S which I said I don't like (particularly for the exact same reasons that I think you have expressed concerns about in a number of your posts-- i.e., the rear and the wheel flares).I don't know how I could be more clear on this, or what you are missing.  I love the W220, like the W140, and therefore like (not love) the lsthat looks much like the W140.  I dislike the new W221, which looks nothing like the current LexusLS.  To me, there is no inconsistency in liking the current lsmore than the upcoming S.  But my personal value system puts more emphasis on reliability and long term ownership experience than on styling-- so I chose the lsover the current S when it came to spending my own money, not just looking at pictures.So what are we disagreeing about with regard to the W140, the W220 and the W221?I also agree that the '07 lsdesign is likely pretty locked down at this point.  But that doesn't mean that over the last year or two the Lexus folks weren't following MB's design prototypes even more closely than the typical Edmunds forum poster did (I may be jaundiced, but I don't think corporate espionage ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall), and my comment was only meant to emphasize my expectation that Lexus will continue in its own direction rather than try to emulate the direction MB has taken the S.

" What about the fact that buyers TODAY have more choices of high-end lux cars than in the past, say a decade ago, that you don't understand ? Lexus and Infiniti are new entrants within the past 15 years, right ? Prior to 1990, its either MB or BMW... Now Lexus via its LexusLS, and Infiniti via its G cars have provided much better competition to the dominance of the traditional leaders (MB and BMW). I got that part long ago, its the relevence I'm trying to figure out.  First it was MB isn't the choice for the high-end buyer, now it has shifted to there are more choices.  We all know that. Anyone can see this.  Sure the market has expanded and MB and BMW have expanded their sales with it.    Back before Lexus and all the newcomers MB/BMW never broke 100K sales a year, now they're both over 200K a year.  Prior to 1990, there was Jaguar, Audi, and Cadillac also, not just BMW and Mercedes.  Were those others good choices?  Thats open for debate for sure, but they were there sure enough. I never argued that buyers don't have more choices today, only that MB is still the main choice for the high-end buyer, which is what you started out with a few posts back.  Infiniti's G35 has nothing to do with your original point about MB and the high-end buyer or the high-end luxury buyer period. The Q45 does however and its a dud of the highest order.  Infiniti isn't even a player at the high-end of the market.  Audi sells more A8s than Infiniti does Q45s. Of course there is more competition all around, I didn't debate that.  I couldn't debate that with a 1/2 dozen newer and/or revised cars in the E's segment alone this year,  for example.  Yes, 7Series may be selling well for a 7Series, but it remains a distant third to the LexusLS. So I am looking at the bigger picture of the entire class, not the narrow picture of solely the 7Series sales record...So what, the 7Series costs more than the LexusLS to begin with.  Secondly how are you looking at the whole picture when the gist of your post is again about sales compared to the lsand not BMW's bottom line?  You're only looking at sales relative to a much cheaper car and ignoring the fact that the current 7Series has surpassed the record for any 7Series before it. Why is it that the 7Series has to outsell the lsfor it to be a success in your eyes, but the GS doesn't have to outsell the 5Series to be a hit?  Major contradiction there.  Sales, again aren't the sole indicator of whether or not a car is a success or not.

" Where exactly did anyone say that? The silly comments about Lexus being an upscale Buick make you look bad. if it was that easy GM would have upgraded Buick or Cadillac a long time ago. The moment I see a comment like that is the moment I know I'm dealing with a a person who can't handle Lexus' success. As for the IS - they are buying the success of the brand's quality and reliability and assuming it's in the IS. It is said here all the time by the Lexuscamp.  Lexus is just ""better"" with no reason as to why.  What do the founding Lexi like the LexusES and lsreally have over a Buick other than rwd and and of course a better quality of build?  Seriously whether or not the question makes me ""look bad"" a real answer would be nice.  No, I'm not saying that a Lexus isn't superior to those GM cars, but I'd like to hear why you think they (the car not the dealer and what not) are. A ES350 is a much of a Lexus as the LexusLS is and it certainly is as good as the GS for what Lexus buyers buy them for.  Seriously why would anyone shopping for a Lexus buy a GS over a LexusES or even LexusLS unless they need more room as in the case of the LS? I really would like to know this from you because you've spoken so highly of the lsand besides the room what does it really give you over an ES?  The concept (reliablity, lots of beige leather and isolation) is the same. For eons MB's story was bullet proof reliability, rarely was performance and MB ever mentioned together until the last 10 years when MB moved more in that direction. True, but this is where the heritage part comes in becuse Mercedes was know more for innovations than reliablity as Toyota/Lexus fans know it today.  Unlike Lexus, Mercedes' story included that about their reliablity, but it also included innovations. I mean look at the things they've introduced to the market that EVERY car in production uses now.  That alone was worth its weight in gold.  Mercedes was also known for their racing victories too along with performance LJ.  That about performance having only come up in the last 10 years simply isn't true and is sure sign of someone not really familiar with the brand.  Mercedes bigger cars back in day are what created all that autobahn high-speed talk. A 1986 560SEL would do 140mph and could get 60 mph in 7.0 second flat, which was fast for that time. The only part of Mercedes performance resume that has been improved in the last 10 years is how they handle, not much else because a lot of their cars were always powerful and fast.  Just because you've only heard performance and Mercedes mentioned together only recently doesn't mean it hasn't always been there. Mercedes' reliability was so stellar because of all the other European cars of the day were much worse and anything American was just junk.   When people say this I find it funny  because MB's peers of the day were BMW/Audi/Jaguar, not a reliable one in that bunch back then so of course Mercedes looked as though it was not of this earth.  Of course when the Japanese moved the bar beyond Mercedes and Mercedes made some mistakes in the 90's this problem got worse, but I seriously doubt a Mercedes-Benz was ever like a modern day Toyota in reliablity.

If you have seen the error in your previous position and swung to embrace the common thread on this topic, so be it.

Are you implying that a greater proportion of those who lease the LexusLS cannot afford to lease an SClass ? Yet the SClass sells so pitifully against the LexusLS.

There it goes again, among the cars that Lexus offer, they beat MB class for class. So don't compare cars Lexus does not make i.e. AMG car lines. I even bet you: if Lexus makes cars costing $100K or more in the future, they will still beat MB class for class. Lexus isn't even close to beating MB class for class.  The SC430 got beat by the previous generation CLK430 and the current SL500, the GS may be scoring a point victory in the mags over  EClass  now, but the E crushes the GS in the every important (at least here it is)  sales race.

" You are quick to rag on the GS, but the last gen did VERY WELL in direct comparisons to the 540 and E420 in competitive comparisons, just not in sales.I dont really remember that. The GS picked up an Import of the year in MT for '98 (which doesnt mean all that much, MT has given plenty of ""of the year's"" to some terrible cars), and it was a 10-best winner once, maybe twice. Once the A6 actually got more than 200hp though, the GS would always lose to it and the 5. The 540i was a beloved car that dominated comparison tests like the 3Series still does. I don't recall the 98-05 GS ever getting an outright 1st place in any comparo vs the Germans. It really wasn't that great of a car. The V8 was very fast in a straight line, but handling was just average, and it had the all-time worst Lexus interior.I wouldnt expect anything for the GS any time soon other than an engine swap, and possibly a VDIM off button. If sales were like the RL's it would be getting emergency treatment, but I think as long as it maintains 2K+ a month, they will stay the course.I dont think the new LexusES looks bad. It certainly is better looking than the ES330. The one thing I think they messed up is that in order to fit with the ""L-finesse"" interior design theme of the other new sedans, they took out almost all of the wood from the last car. The interior is a lot more modern, but it also seems somewhat less luxurious.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" You say that the Q7 has a boring ad. Well picture this, an RX350 ad that shows the car driving at night then all of a sudden it crosses paths with a deer. The ad was to highlight the swivel headlights of the RX. Nothing special as every carmaker has them now. No word on the mechanicals of the RX. Not utility. Not seating configurations. Nothing. Haven't even seen ads for the LexusES and IS yet. But they're still running the 1 year old ads on the LS', maybe in an attempt to sell the leftovers, which is brilliant.That RX ad is not my favorite, but it still works very well. Most people probably aren't aware that most luxury cars have swiveling headlights now (anyway, Tucker and Citroen did the swiveling headlight thing LONG before Lexus, Mercedes, or Audi). The RX ad points out a fancy feature on the Lexus people may not be aware of, using a memorable situation. The ""dimpled panels"" ad for the lsis very similar. They don't have to get into something as boring as mechanicals or seating configurations. Mechanicals are for sports cars, and seating configurations are for minivans. The RX is neither. The point of a TV ad should be to get you to remember the car. The RX ad does that. The Q7 ad does not. The IS350 ads aim squarely at 3Series buyers, so pretty much all the talk is about its 306 hp and how fast it is. The LexusES ""Is it possible to engineer desire?"" ad uses robotic ""fingers"" to slam home the message of interior luxury. Why cant Audi come up with something clever and memorable like that? Pretty much all of the mags agree that their interiors are magnificent, but I can't remember a single Audi commercial that even mentioned their interiors at all.The Q7 commercial reminded me of something Mercury or some other brand that has no idea of its mission or what its products are about would do. Play song, show car, wrap it up with ""Q7, from the makers of Quattro"". I'm already in a coma. Audi isn't like that, they do have great products, you just wouldn't know it by seeing the ad.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" You seem to say best value doesn't mean ""best"" overall..According to the recent Road and Track, Car and Driver, JDP, CR, and Resale Values, High price doesn't mean BEST either....You still don't explain why Lexus makes more Profit off the LexusLS than MB makes off a SClass DESPITE being 15K less!!! You subscribe to the foolish notion that Pricier means better...Did you know a $15 Timex is more reliable and accurate than a 15K Rolex??? I never said that high price always meant &#147;best&#148;, but in this particular instance it does. The LexusLS is a good value, but that doesn&#146;t mean that it&#146;s the best. You can spend more on an SClass and get the best or you can spend 70% of that on the lsand get 70% of the car. As far as your watch analogy is concerned: Apples and Oranges. The differences between highly complex, multi-faceted products such as luxury cars can&#146;t be boiled down to the simple difference between a Rolex and a Timex. If anything Lexus is a battery powered knock-off Rolex made of yellow plastic with a quartz movement. Sounds like the high price of the S is due to inefficiency more than price premium..Here's where profits are important: Less profit, less R&D..As far as I've seen it, Toyota has taken on R&D projects where it can profit immensely from. You're completely ignoring the whole business side to this. Yes I am ignoring the business side to this. I&#146;m not comparing the fiscal policies of MB and Lexus, I am comparing their products. Just because Lexus is more profitable (which you haven&#146;t proven) than MB doesn&#146;t mean that Lexus makes better cars. Less R&D? Is that why most of the features on your lscame from the MB or BMW R&D department? Is less R&D why Lexus is still riding on the coattails of MB for innovation? Interesting.  Actually Boeing and Airbus differ big time on design. Fly by Wire vs Mechanical Controls is a HUGE issue in the aviation world. (Air Force 1 does not have Fly by Wire, despite it being available at the time) British Airways has insisted the 747 Advanced NOT have Fly by wire. The 747 has triple redunancy on all critical systems whereas the A340 has two. The 747 does have more innovative safety features than the A340, yet this has not stopped airlines from buying the Airbus..You should stop and think whether any corporation is going to open themselves up to lawsuits from a product that is ""unsafe"" or ""poorly engineered"" That&#146;s probably because no body knows these details. If the public knew that Boeing made a safer jet than Airbus, you can be sure that airlines that fly Boeing would get more business. Much is the same with Lexus and Mercedes. Most people are sheep who follow the Lexus cult ignorant of the fact that Lexus lags behind the market for safety, doesn&#146;t even offer rear side airbags or that the SC430 doesn&#146;t have rollover protection. And if you think corporations don&#146;t take chances with products that are &#147;unsafe&#148; I submit to you Hyundai, possibly the most unsafe vehicles as per IIHS crash tests. Also, GM and Ford are currently involved in a number of class action lawsuits regarding their poorly engineered SUV/Truck roofs that collapse in rollovers because they are still designed to 1970s strength specifications, while Volvo/MB/BMW have exceeded those specifications five times over for decades.  Given that Lexus commands a high customer loyalty I doubt they'd risk their business by building cars that are unsafe. If they can spend $4 Billion on the original LexusLS do you think they'd skimp on $500 electronics?? They've chose to spend their R&D on Award Winning Customer Service, NAV's, Hybrids, superior reliability, and cutting edge electronics whilst building a car that is STILL recommended by the NHTSA and various other agencies for safety.. Well obviously they decided to skimp in $500 rear airbags, $500 roll protection bars (SC), and $500 rear load limiters on most models. They skimped on the passenger airbags for 4 years. They skimped on head protection airbags for 2 years. They also decided to wait 4 years after MB and BMW to adopt the most significant safety feature since the seatbelt, ESC. IIHS and NHTSA crash tests do not account for safety features such as these and only provide us with a limited view of a cars comprehensive safety in two designer tests.  When you add up all the skimping, waiting and corner cutting that Lexus has done over the years, it&#146;s obvious that they aren&#146;t exactly the most safety conscious brand.  It only makes sense to assume that a company like Mercedes would offer more comprehensive protection in all types of crashes because safety is a hallmark of their brand. Who would you expect to build a better race car? Someone with years of innovation, experience and leadership in the segment or a newcomer with a questionable record? Much the same can be said for safety. It&#146;s a hard thing to accept as long as you are blinded by brand loyalty and bias, so think of it this way, with two companies; company A and company B:Company A has been in the business of making safe cars for over 100 years. Company A offers the most standard and optional safety features than any other brand. Company A has introduced many important safety advances such as crumple zones, ABS, stability control, and seat belt pre-tensioners, just to name a FEW things. Company A is one of only two companies with active accident investigation teams to assess real world collisions in order to modify their designs. Company A offers the latest and greatest safety features and structural designs before most other brands. Company B has been in the business of making affordable cars for 15 years. Company B hasn&#146;t introduced any of its own pioneering safety features nor has it shown any particular interest in safety innovation. Company B often waits several years before it adopts the safety features pioneered by company A and others. Company B still doesn&#146;t offer many of the basic safety features that have been found in company A&#146;s cars for years. Assuming you have no bias, which of these two brands has an obvious advantage in the area of safety? Which would you expect to perform better in an accident? It seems pretty clear to me. Most people would pick company A, but if you&#146;re a Lexus fan you might pick company B.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" You seemed to pick on the Lexus interior, and mentioned it is ""Good in a straight line"". Actually, that was me. Quoting myself: The V8 was very fast in a straight line, but handling was just average, and it had the all-time worst Lexus interior.There's a big difference between objective and subjective results on a car. The GS might be able to match the numbers, but it ""felt"" sloppy compared to the 540, espeically w/ sport package. I think you'll find that most journalists would agree with that. I didnt have any problems with the audio and HVAC controls, Lexus always has done those in a very simple and straightfoward manner, and the GS was no exception. The problem was the rest of the interior. The design was incredibly dull, and it did not befit a $50K luxury car. Nearly all of it was either plastic or vinyl. It is definitely the hands down winner for worst Lexus interior. The 5Series and especially the A6 were vastly superior on the inside, in both design and materials. I feel rather strange defending the Germans, but despite the GS's reliability and its 0-60 prowess, the 5 and A6 were just better cars than the last gen GS. Looking at the three of them, its amazing just how brilliant that A6 interior was. The E430, GS400, and 540i interiors all look quite dated now, but the A6 looks just as sleek and modern now as it did then.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" You stated that the A8 was less ""safe"" than the LexusLS Where did I say that?  I implied that using aluminum only served to make the vehicle less safe than it otherwise would have been (ie. using steel in the same place as aluminum).  Aluminum being a much more brittle metal with much lower melting and flaming temperature, is certainly less safe than steel sheet metal.  The bending of sheet metal is a large part of the crumple zone's safety feature. the Germans were about safety long before the Japanese or Americans, only the Swedish understood the concept. (1) Even if your statement were true, then it's truely sad Germans no longer seems to hold that advantage; well, perhaps not.(2) In reality, MB and BMW historically had crash results, whereas Audis were historically poor.  Look at the A6 on IIHS for yourself.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Your Logic would make Chrysler and Mercedes the same company...Heck Chrysler is carrying Mercedes. There is a HUGE difference between the Toyota/Lexus connection and the Mercedes/Chrysler connection. Mercedes and Chrysler were independent companies long before 1998 when Daimler-Benz purchased Chrysler group. Despite financial links, Mercedes maintains its independence as a separate entity from its corporate siblings. On the other-hand we have Toyota/Lexus. This isn&#146;t a matter of one company owning another company or one company merging with another company? Lexus quite literally IS Toyota in every sense. In Japan you won&#146;t find a domestic Lexus LexusLS on the road but you will see plenty of Toyota Celisors. &#147;Lexus&#148; was just re-badge stunt pulled here in the U.S. to lure unwitting American&#146;s into paying $60k for a Toyota. So yes, Lexus and Toyota are the same company? its been that way from the beginning.  All the Technology in the World is valueless if it doesn't work properly ..As I recall someone has already posted a list of often purchased parts that could effect the safety of the car.There was so much wrong with that link I&#146;m not sure where to begin. He tried to pull a fast one on all of us by posting some sort of amateur &#147;e-bay seller site&#148; and then telling us that it was definitive proof of Mercedes reliability issues. Furthermore, he claimed that he &#147;didn&#146;t see Lexus&#148; on this oh-so-professional and accurate website? which would make sense considering it was a European site and Lexus doesn&#146;t even appear on the radar in Europe.  I countered by listing a news release that told of a recent recall of 150k Camry&#146;s due to defective side airbags. Furthermore, I linked to an insurance page that listed several &#147;safety problems&#148; with Lexus vehicles. The point is, if you&#146;re going to provide &#147;proof&#148; of Mercedes reliability issues, at least provide some credible proof. Also, if you&#146;re going to preach about the reliability, don&#146;t pretend that Lexus is invincible. Rear seat airbags are of little value the Curtins that protect your head and the seatbelts are the essentual safety features...So Called safety features with little more value then bragging effect is worth how much?Wrong. I am simply floored by this comment. I understand that you may want to mitigate Lexus&#146; disregard for safety by belittling the importance of side airbags, but you simply cannot. Side airbags are vital in any type of side impact. Side head airbags (pioneered by BMW) ONLY protect the head. Side airbags provide protection for the torso and pelvis that a seatbelt alone cannot. The presence of a side airbag can mean the difference between life and death. Just look at some of the side impact tests on the IIHS website and notice how cars without side airbags score extremely poorly and those same cars with side airbags score markedly better. Saying that side airbags are unimportant is just as ridiculous as saying front airbags and seatbelts are frivolous features. They once did have a great reputation for safety and innovation...If I were buying a 60s or 70s or even 80s car it would be a Mercedes..Times change many cars now have learned from Mercedes and even helped move many of Mercedes safety innovations into the 21st. Century, The result is many cars now rival Mercedes in the area of safety. The problem with this statement is that Mercedes STILL DOES have a great reputation for safety and innovation. You speak in the past tense, that they &#147;did&#148; have a great reputation, even though Mercedes has been churning out safety innovations throughout the 90s and into the present. Please, explain to me how others have &#147;helped move many innovations into the 21st century.&#148; Last I checked, Mercedes was the one of the only ones pioneering these advances and furthermore had all the latest and greatest features years before Lexus. Only Volvo and BMW come close to matching the sheer number of Mercedes safety innovations. Lexus has contributed absolutely nothing and continues to leach off the R&D of others to this day.You constantly talk about cost cutting in the Lexus...That is true but far from the Negative you seem to want to project it to be.It seems pretty negative to me that Lexus decided to skimp and save $100 on their flagship sedan by not including rear side airbags. It seems pretty negative to me that Lexus decides to nickel and dime its customers for optional safety features like pre-safe.  It seems pretty negative that Lexus waits upwards of 4 years before adopting critical safety features on its models like ESC and head airbags, and even then makes some of these features optional / half-assed on lower priced models.  Correct me if I&#146;m wrong, but these are just a few of the many instances of Lexus cost cutting that seem pretty negative?The cost saving results partially from Lexus perfected heavy use of robots to build cars...the resulting percision is one of the primary reasons for the Lexus Reliability EDGE....Again, I already acknowledge that Lexus is more reliable. In fact, reliability is the only redeeming value of Toyota. Hopefully Toyota will force MB to make its cars more reliable, and then people won't have any reason to preach about the virtues of Lexus. However, for me reliability takes a back seat on my priority list when I shop for a car.            ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
